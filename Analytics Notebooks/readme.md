WorldPop develops peer-reviewed research and methods for the construction of open and high-resolution data on population distributions, demographic and dynamics with a focus on low and middle income countries. In this analysis we have used the Individual Countries 2000-2020 UN Adjusted data aggregated to 1 km resolution using 100 m resolution population counts dataset. Read more at WorldPop
GADM maps the administrative areas of all countries, at all levels of sub-division, providing data at high spatial resolutions that includes an extensive set of attributes. We have used the GADM data for India to demarcate the administrative boundaries.

The code mainly have two outputs -

1. Change in population over time as raster file at a resolution of 1 km
