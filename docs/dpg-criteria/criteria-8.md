- **Design with the user and Understanding the existing ecosystem**
The design and development of the DiCRA platform was initiated following a multistakeholder consultation and innovation workshop involving government, development organisations, data scientists, domain experts in agriculture and food and farmers. Throughout the project lifecycle, regular consultations with these identified counterparts were organised to ensure continuous integration of userâ€™s feedback into the development of the platform.
