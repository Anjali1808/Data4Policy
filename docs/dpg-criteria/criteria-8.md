# Does the project adhere to standards and best practices?

DiCRA Platform is designed and developed according to the **Principles for Digital Development** following a Human-centred design approach.

We have used the Digital Principles Maturity Matrix to analyse, plan, design, develop and implement the DiCRA Platform.  The Digital Principles Maturity Matrix offers a dynamic tool to go through a series of statements that measure alignment with the Digital Principles. Statements are grouped according Digital Principle, project lifecycle phase, and specific activity (e.g., “Design With the User,” “Analyze & Plan,” and “User Advisory Group (UAG)”) to create a consistent approach across sectors, technology, and context-specific use cases. 

## Design with the user and Understanding the existing ecosystem

The design of the DiCRA platform was initiated following a multistakeholder consultation and innovation workshop involving government, development organisations, data scientists, domain experts in agriculture and food and farmers. Throughout the project lifecycle, regular consultations with these identified counterparts were organised to ensure continuous integration of user’s feedback into the development of the platform.

This workshop supported by Rockefeller Foundation resulted in a vision document for the design and development of DiCRA Platform. The summary and highlights from the workshop is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xIH3-wsemIAAliYDS7WY5y9XJhp6vAZc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110975755767573809867&rtpof=true&sd=true).

UNDP have also signed partnership agreement with [Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad](http://rich.telangana.gov.in) to conduct focus group discussion with farmers throughout the project lifecycle regarding the impact of climate change on their livelihoods and document good practices and challenges systematically. Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad (RICH), a Telangana Government initiative and the nodal agency appointed by the Office of Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India for Hyderabad Cluster, aims to bring research institutions, academic institutions, industry, startups, incubators, accelerators, VCs, civil society members, and Governments on a common platform to fast-track innovation.

We will also follow the guidelines outlined in [SIMLab's Monitoring and Evaluation Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjF0Nccn6LTtwE7uTVBtcYbh0lsqWmQ_O0txEamUxNs/edit?usp=sharing) for measuring the impact of DiCRA platform over time.

## Design for Scale and Be Collaborative
Infrastructure and ownership is currently  for 3 years, financial robustness is being ensured beyond that period.There is also a collabortive consortium around DiCRA platform who will iteratively not only improve the platform, but make sure insights from platform are used in policy- and decision- making across state and national government counterparts. This will ensur investments and resources being available continously for scaling and improving the platform.

DiCRA  is a result of collaboration and co-creation between multiple national and international organisations -

* Government of Telangana's ecosystem players including the Emerging Technologies Wing, Agriculture Department, Agricultural University, etc. who provide perspective on what is needed from policy- and decision- making perspective.
* UNDP India's Inclusive Growth and Accelerator Lab Team who bring diverse and extensive development sector and public policy expertise
* Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad who bring experience in directly working with farmers, FPOs, non-profits, startups who are invested in contributing to augmenting the innovation capabilities in Agriculture and Foods Systems across the state. Even when DiCRA is scaled for other country or region contexts, identifying such a stakeholder would be critical to make sure the platform is designed for 
* Policy research and advocacy towards mainstreaming climate resilience and data-driven approaches in Food Systems of Telangana will also be 
* international research organisations such as [Zero Hunger Lab](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/impact/creating-value-data/zero-hunger-lab), [Jheronimus Academy of Data Science](https://www.jads.nl) and others to offer expertise and peer-review the content generated by DiCRA Platform.

## Build for Sustainability

Accounts for varied definitions and conditions of sustainability and pinpoints them to the specific contexts of the project. These pinpoints are linked to the project's theory of change and clear stakeholder engagements are also identified.

## Be Data Driven
The website allows the users to download in geospatial data formats any open data layer that is being visualized in the platform. Open APIs? Formats? Interoperable? Metadata

## Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation

Open standards establish protocols and building blocks that can help make digital public goods more functional and interoperable. This not only streamlines product development, it removes vendor-imposed boundaries to read or write data files by improving data exchange. Below are some of the common open standards by category:

### Accessibility

WCAG 2.0/2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

### Security

**HTTPS**
**SSH** is used to connect to the VM from external applications
**SSL**

### Authentication & Authorization

OAuth 2
OIDC (OpenID Connect)
JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
XACML 3.0 (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language)

### Web standards

HTML
CSS
ECMAScript (ES 5/6/7)
Latex

### Software Architectural Styles

REST (Representational State Transfer)

### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

OpenAPI

### Data Exchange formats

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
XML (Extensible Markup Language)
CSV (Comma Separated Values)
COG(Cloud 

### Software Quality Assurance

IEEE
ISO/IEC

### Software Testing

IEEE829
ISO/IEC/IEEE29119

## Reuse and Improve

## Address Privacy and Security
