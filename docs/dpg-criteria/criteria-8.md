# Does the project adhere to standards and best practices?

DiCRA Platform is designed and developed according to the **Principles for Digital Development** following a Human-centred design approach.

We have used the Digital Principles Maturity Matrix to analyse, plan, design, develop and implement the DiCRA Platform.  The Digital Principles Maturity Matrix offers a dynamic tool to go through a series of statements that measure alignment with the Digital Principles. Statements are grouped according Digital Principle, project lifecycle phase, and specific activity (e.g., “Design With the User,” “Analyze & Plan,” and “User Advisory Group (UAG)”) to create a consistent approach across sectors, technology, and context-specific use cases. 

## Design with the user and Understanding the existing ecosystem

The design of the DiCRA platform was initiated following a multistakeholder consultation and innovation workshop involving government, development organisations, data scientists, domain experts in agriculture and food and farmers. Throughout the project lifecycle, regular consultations with these identified counterparts were organised to ensure continuous integration of user’s feedback into the development of the platform.

This workshop supported by Rockefeller Foundation resulted in a vision document for the design and development of DiCRA Platform. The summary and highlights from the workshop is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xIH3-wsemIAAliYDS7WY5y9XJhp6vAZc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110975755767573809867&rtpof=true&sd=true).

UNDP have also signed partnership agreement with [Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad](http://rich.telangana.gov.in) to conduct focus group discussion with farmers throughout the project lifecycle regarding the impact of climate change on their livelihoods and document good practices and challenges systematically. Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad (RICH), a Telangana Government initiative and the nodal agency appointed by the Office of Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India for Hyderabad Cluster, aims to bring research institutions, academic institutions, industry, startups, incubators, accelerators, VCs, civil society members, and Governments on a common platform to fast-track innovation.

We will also follow the guidelines outlined in [SIMLab's Monitoring and Evaluation Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjF0Nccn6LTtwE7uTVBtcYbh0lsqWmQ_O0txEamUxNs/edit?usp=sharing) for measuring the impact of DiCRA platform over time.

## Design for Scale, Be Collaborative and Build for Sustainability
Infrastructure and ownership is currently  for 3 years, financial robustness is being ensured beyond that period.There is also a collabortive consortium around DiCRA platform who will iteratively not only improve the platform, but make sure insights from platform are used in policy- and decision- making across state and national government counterparts. This will ensur investments and resources being available continously for scaling and improving the platform.

DiCRA  is a result of collaboration and co-creation between multiple national and international organisations -

* Government of Telangana's ecosystem players including the Emerging Technologies Wing, Agriculture Department, Agricultural University, etc. who provide perspective on what is needed from policy- and decision- making perspective.
* UNDP India's Inclusive Growth and Accelerator Lab Team who bring diverse and extensive development sector and public policy expertise
* Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad who bring experience in directly working with farmers, FPOs, non-profits, startups who are invested in contributing to augmenting the innovation capabilities in Agriculture and Foods Systems across the state. Even when DiCRA is scaled for other country or region contexts, identifying such a stakeholder would be critical to make sure the platform is designed for scale and sustainability. This partnership also enabled us to have a enhanaced local community engagement strategy.
* Policy research and advocacy towards mainstreaming climate resilience and data-driven approaches in Food Systems of Telangana will also be executed by [Think Through Consulting](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thinkthrough-consulting/?originalSubdomain=in).
* International research organisations such as [Zero Hunger Lab](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/impact/creating-value-data/zero-hunger-lab), [Jheronimus Academy of Data Science](https://www.jads.nl) and others to offer expertise and peer-review the data, analytics and publications generated by DiCRA Platform.

All the elements of the inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact of the project and stakeholder engagements are identified, and monitored throughout the project lifecycle. The stakeholders meet at specific intervals of time to discuss and provide feedback to continously improve the platform.

## Be Data Driven
The multistakeholder consultations and community of experts have and is continously providing feedback on the type, granularity, and frequency of the datasets and what should be prioritised. This also takes into account localized data use and technical literacy of the users of the platform. Each type of data goes through a rigorous quality check and exploratory analysis before being onboaredd into the platform, and is continously monitored and updated as and when required. The data privacy policy is clear, inclusive, and is documented in our github repository. The policy advocacy component of the project will clearly tie the analysis to outcomes and results at the policy and decision-making level. 

## Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation

We use the follow the following Open standards to establish protocols to make DiCRA more functional and interoperable. 

#### Security - HTTPS, SSL, SSH and OWASP

#### Web standards - HTML, CSS, ECMAScript (ES 5/6/7)

#### Software Architectural Styles - REST architectural style 

#### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) - OpenAPI

#### Data Exchange formats- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), GeoJSON, CSV (Comma Separated Values), GeoTIFF, and COG (Cloud Optimized Geotiff)

#### Multimedia - SVG, PNG (Portable Network Graphics), JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

- We use open source tools and techniques as much as possible, and only when alternatives do not meet the standards and accessibility required we shift to other options. Even then we document clearly the reasons for making this choice and provide alternatives.

- To facilitate open innovation around the platform, our strategy is to regularly host innovation challenges and hackathons, along with making our GitHub set up to facilitate collaboration from the open community. One example is the [Climate Data Hackathon](https://climatedataprogram.org/challenges/) which was recently conducted resulting in several high quality innovations around the use of data in the platform.

## Reuse and Improve
As explained above, DiCRA follows a thorough collaboration strategy that integrates landscape assessments, domain experise, and international community of practitioners to ensure that the project design is as exhaustive as possible. This have resulted in highly iterative approach to understanding user and expert feedback that can enable the project to be as additive as possible and leverage existing resources effectively and efficiently. Our documentation, website, and GitHub provides openly a exhaustive list of partners and stakeholders that have clear investment in the long-term improvability of the project through contracting, Statement of Intents, and Memorandum of Understanding. All the documentation pertaining to the project remains accessible to both the user and project community through GitHub.

## Address Privacy and Security
 Each type of data goes through a rigorous quality check and exploratory analysis before being onboaredd into the platform, and is continously monitored and updated as and when required. The data management of the project is done adhering to strict privacy and security standards.Even when the data is having one of the more permissible licenses, we clearly document the data use agrrements, citation guidelines, etc. to make fair use of data. We collect minimal sensitive information and have put into place technical mechanisms to properly manage sensitive information in the long-term.
