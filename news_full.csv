From paddy to palm oil: Telangana focuses on water intensive crops,"After a push for paddy production, the Telangana government is focussing on expanding oil palm cultivation. Both paddy and oil palm and water intensive crops.

The government has made a push to increase its irrigation potential with mega water projects but experts say that it is not a sustainable way and could have an impact on water resources in the future.

Telangana is the second largest cultivator of oil palm in India, after Andhra Pradesh. The Indian government has been pushing for increased domestic oil palm cultivation to meet the demand for palm oil that is currently being met primarily by imports.

This is the second article in a two-part series on oil palm cultivation in Telangana. Part One discusses the state’s ambitious plans to expand oil palm cultivation.

B. Bucchaya, a 62-year-old farmer, is harvesting fresh oil palm fruits from his farm in Khammam district of Telangana. He will sell these to the nearest oil processing unit and make quick money. Not too far away, Mohammad Salim is growing paddy over four acres of his agricultural land.

This is a common sight in Khammam and now across agricultural land in Telangana as well — large tracts of paddy fields interspersed with patches of young and old oil palm fields.

After a push for paddy crop over the past few years, the Telangana government is now boosting oil palm cultivation. Both paddy and oil palm are water-intensive crops. In line with the plan to increase cultivation of these crops, Telangana has also increased irrigation facilities, over the past eight or so years, from 2014, when Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were bifurcated into separate states.

Studies and government records suggest that agriculture in Telangana is moving away from traditional crops like oil seeds, pulses and vegetables, which were commonly grown in this region, towards paddy and oil palm in recent years.

According to the latest annual socio-economic outlook of the state, production of paddy has increased by 378 percent between 2015-16 and 2020-21 in Telangana. Meanwhile, the production of oil palm has increased almost three times from 75,447 Metric Tonnes (MT) in 2015-16 to 2,08,826 MT in 2020-21. During the same period, the annual report shows that the percentage of gross sown area of traditional crops such as groundnut, Bengal gram and sesamum, continued to decrease.

Shift to water intensive crops

Oil palm is a water intensive crop, with one tree requiring 200 to 300 litres of water per day. While this may be lower than what the typical water intensive crops such as sugarcane and paddy use, it is still a considerable amount that could impact water resources.

On March 7, this year, the Telangana government presented its state budget and allocated Rs. 10 billion for the current fiscal year, exclusively for expanding oil palm plantation in the state. T. Harish Rao, the state finance minister who presented the budget, said, in his speech, that until 2014, the region that is now Telangana had issues of drought and lack of irrigation, but current irrigation facilities in the state have improved.

Rao in his speech said, “In 2014, water was available only for (irrigating) 20 lakh acres (of agricultural land) in Telangana. By 2021, this has increased to 85.89 lakh acres.” He also said that owing to the growing demand for palm oil as well as increased irrigation potential in the state, Telangana plans to expand land under oil palm cultivation.

According to the state government’s latest plan, it has planned to bring 20 lakh acres of land under oil palm plantation in the next five years against the existing 90,000 acres. The government, in the latest budget, also highlighted what is currently the world’s largest multi-stage lift irrigation project, Kaleshwaram, on Godavari river basin and other irrigation projects which helped in boosting irrigation in the state.

However, it is not only the state government who wants expansion of oil palm in Telangana, but also the federal government that has given a target of adding three lakh (300,000) acres of land for oil palm in the next five years under the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) scheme. A central re-assessment committee with members from The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)’s constituent organisation, India Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), in 2021, had recommended expanding oil palm plantation from four districts of Telangana to 27 districts of the state owing to the increased irrigation facilities.

Currently Telangana is second in India, after Andhra Pradesh, in the quantity of palm oil it produces. According to data from the directorate of agriculture and farmers welfare, Andhra Pradesh produced 2,95,075 metric tonnes (MT) of crude palm oil in 2021-22, the highest in India, which was followed by Telangana which produced 46,171 MT during the same period.

Likely ecological threats

But what does this transition of Telangana agriculture from traditional crops to commercial and water intensive crops such as paddy and oil palm mean for the state’s environment and agriculture?

The Telangana state horticulture department says that an increase in oil palm plantation will not pose a hazard to the state’s agriculture and ecology. “In other largest (palm oil) producing countries in the world like Malaysia and Indonesia the story was different where due to expansion of oil palm, there was deforestation. But in Telangana, we are mainly boosting oil palm on agricultural land. Also, irrigation facilities in the state have increased manifold in the last few years. We are also judicious about not using these plants in urban areas of six of the water deficient districts of the state. This will only help in giving better financial security to the farmers,” an official from the state horticulture department said, on the condition of anonymity.

However, experts from the agriculture and water sector have apprehensions about the proposed plan of the state government and the union government to expand oil palm plantation in the state on a large scale.

Devinder Sharma, a noted agriculture and food policy expert from Chandigarh claimed that the whole policy of supporting a crop like oil palm that requires a significant amount of water is a “wrongly conceived” idea which could have alarming consequences in the state in future. “This is the same kind of mistake Punjab made decades ago. Intensive cropping of water-guzzling plants like paddy has led to decreased groundwater levels in this state. Why are states like Telangana trying to make the same kind of mistakes and become the next Punjab in the years to come? In Telangana, there is short sightedness. If there is an increase in irrigation and better water availability, we should not ruthlessly exploit and literally allow mining of water resources thereby depriving our future generations of the precious resource,” he told Mongabay-India.

He also added, “In the race to compete with other states to commercialise production, they are on their way to destroy agriculture. Moreover, it has been done for a cheaper and sub-standard edible oil. It is always better to boost our own high quality edible oil crops to minimise the gap between total domestic production and total consumption.”

The groundwater level in Telangana is not significantly impacted so far. Since 2018, the depth to the ground water level has been decreasing, which means the water level itself has been increasing. Experts that Mongabay-India spoke to claim it is because of the good rains the state had been receiving. According to government data, the state received 46 percent excess rainfall in 2020-21 and normal rainfall in the last five years, leading to timely recharge of groundwater.

But there could be other factors that increase the demand for groundwater. For example, studies have indicated that even a one percent increase in average temperature due to reasons like climate change, could lead to 10 percent additional demand for irrigated water in arid and semi-arid areas. Telangana is a semi-arid region, according to the state government.

Water blues

Experts claimed that owing to the geography of Telangana, a focus on water intensive agriculture could impact the water resources, including groundwater, significantly in the future, in addition to having other environmental impacts. Telangana, in the Deccan plateau, is situated on an elevation and the government in the state had been using lift irrigation and other ways to pull water from rivers to cater to the large irrigation needs of the state. The demand for irrigation is likely to increase with the increase in oil palm cultivation.

Himanshu Thakker, Coordinator at the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP) told Mongabay-India, “In Telangana most of the cultivable land is situated at a higher altitude so there is need to pump water from the rivers to irrigate many of these lands. That is why even the Kaleshwaram dam is mostly pumping water from lower to higher altitude rather than acting as a dam to provide gravity flow irrigation. This is very energy intensive and not sustainable in the long run. Large scale lift irrigation projects have not been successful in the majority of the areas where they were tried.”

Studies have shown that in the past few decades the practice of using wells as sources of water for irrigation, compared to tanks, canals and other sources, has been significantly increasing in this region that’s now part of Telangana. In 2015-16, which is up to when the data is available, over 86 percent of area irrigated in the Telangana region used wells as the source. Several oil palm farmers that Mongabay-India met at Khammam, Suryapet and other parts of Telangana mostly use their wells to irrigate their oil palm fields. Thakker said that the government needs to regulate the use of groundwater resources like wells and tubewells to make the farming sustainable.

He said, “Whenever there is availability of groundwater, there is an increase in the number of tube wells and wells. It is a slow poison and it takes time to show alarming impacts. The groundwater use needs to be regulated at the local level. There needs to be more groundwater recharge. The better way for the government is to go for decentralised rain water harvesting systems. Since the rainfall is good in Telangana, this is a much better option.”

Ramanjaneyulu G.V., an agricultural scientist at the Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture said that Andhra Pradesh tops the list of oil palm production in the country due to the favourable conditions it offers, unlike Telangana.

“If you see Andhra, most of the oil palm plantations are spread in coastal belts of the state because it requires moisture. In Telangana which is an arid region, there is less moisture and dry weather. In such conditions, the yields are likely to be lower and also in future the farmers could face problems due to low yield in case of other problems like lack of water for irrigation. As these are long gestation period crops, this could harm the state more than benefiting it,” he said.

He added, “Two years back the same thrust was given by the government for farmers on increasing paddy cultivation when irrigation in the state increased and now the focus has shifted towards oil palm. State should not push for a particular crop and let the farmers make their own choice. When the state pushes, it is the seed suppliers who make more incomes than farmers. It happens all over.”

"‘Telangana’s agricultural output has increased quickly’, says Niranjan Reddy","Hyderabad: Telangana Agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy and Transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar opened three warehouses with a combined capacity of 20,000 metric tonnes that were constructed on five acres of land for Rs 14.90 crores at Jinkalagudem of Raghunathapalem Mandal in the district on Friday.

According to Agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy, Telangana has had a consistent rise in agricultural production while Congress and BJP-ruled states have seen a decline. “A huge boost in agricultural productivity has resulted from chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao’s pro-farmer policies.”

According to him, Telangana’s agricultural output increased from 62 lakh metric tonnes in 2014 to 3 crore metric tonnes in just one year.

According to Niranjan Reddy, no state in the nation is building new warehouses. The only state building new warehouses as a result of an increase in agricultural production was Telangana. “While Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra maintained the same level of production, Punjab and West Bengal saw declines. With 1.46 crore acres of land under cultivation, Telangana was using the most agricultural land,” he stated.

“The Telangana government has spent close to Rs 1.50 lakh crore on irrigation projects whereas the Modi government at the Center has not completed a single irrigation project in the last eight years,” said Reddy.

He said that the Yasangi Rythu Bandhu sum would be credited in December and that measures to waive crop loans would be made soon. The minister approved Rs 2.50 crore for internal CC roads on the grounds of the newly constructed warehouses at Ajay Kumar’s request.

Ajay Kumar praised Niranjan Reddy in his speech for providing money for warehouses for farmers.

CM KCR took up agriculture as a priority sector and initiated multiple measures to improve the infrastructure as well as supply of power and irrigation water without any disruption.

Hyderabad: With its farmer-friendly initiatives, Telangana is setting new benchmarks in terms of cultivation and agricultural production. The cultivation area has shot up to 2.3 crore acres in 2021-22 against 1.34 crore acres in 2014, while the total paddy production alone escalated from 68 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 to a whopping 2.49 crore tonnes in 2021-22. The total crop production has surpassed 3.5 crore tonnes.

Soon after the State formation, Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao took up agriculture as a priority sector and initiated multiple measures to improve the infrastructure as well as supply of power and irrigation water without any disruption. Further, Rythu Bandhu farm investment support, Rythu Bima farmer life insurance, supply of fertilisers and seeds, have encouraged more farmers to take up agriculture as a serious and remunerative occupation.

In addition to 2.3 crore acres of agricultural cultivation area, the horticultural crops are being cultivated in another 11.5 lakh acres. The cotton cultivation area has increased by 44.7 per cent from 41.83 lakh acres in 2014-15 to 60.53 lakh acres in 2021-22, according to an official statement here.

The State government is procuring the entire paddy crop cultivated by farmers in Telangana. Accordingly, around Rs 1.07 crore have been deposited directly into the bank accounts of farmers to purchase about 6.06 crore tonnes of paddy over the last eight years. Telangana has also been spending nearly Rs 50,000 crore from its annual budget on agriculture and related schemes over the last a few years.

To provide uninterrupted power to farm sector, the State government strengthened the power distribution network with Rs 36,703 crore and has been providing another Rs 10,500 crore every year towards subsidy against power supplied to the farm agriculture sector, officials said.

Under Rythu Bandhu, the State government had deposited around Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers for the last nine phases over five years i.e. a total expenditure of Rs 57,881 crore as investment support to farmers. Further, about 88,963 bereaved families received Rs 5 lakh insurance amount following the demise of farmers covered under Rythu Bima scheme.

Due to increased agricultural activity, the rural economy has been strengthened like never before and the per capita income of people of Telangana has doubled from Rs 1,12,162 in 2014-15 to Rs 2,78,833. The State government took up numerous other initiatives by appointing an agricultural extension officer for every 5,000 acres, to monitor overall agricultural operations in the State, officials said.

Apart from waiving off transport tax on tractors benefiting Rs 273.5 crore to farmers, the government has also improved godown space from 39 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 to 68.28 lakh tonnes in 2021-11, they added.",['Telangana Today'],2022-11-11 20:43:53+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ag.jpg,[],[],,"['Wanaparthy', 'Karimnagar', 'Suryapet']","['Hyderabad', 'Suryapet', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Karimnagar']"

Congress stages protests on farm issues across the State

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy predicted that elections for Assembly would be held anytime and called upon the party workers to be prepared.

“The State Assembly may be dissolved at any time, so get ready for elections. The Congress coming to power is a historical necessity at this juncture. Once coming to power, we will cancel Dharani and offer loan waiver of ₹2 lakh to each farmer,” said Mr. Reddy while participating in a protest before the Collectorate of Vikarabad on Monday.

Stating that State-wide agitations would be taken up on various issues, he alleged that the government is trying to transform farmers as labourers.

Responding to the call given by TPCC, protests were held before Collectorates across the State.

“In the past it was accused that attack took place on our language and our style (yasa). Now the attack is on our agriculture, which is our culture. Efforts are on to handover agriculture to corporate sector,” he said adding that about 80,000 farmers died in the last five years and even Agriculture Minister has accepted it.

Referring to the liquor scam allegedly involving K. Kavitha, and B.L. Santosh of BJP in MLAs poaching case, the TPCC president wondered why these people are failing to present themselves before the investigating agencies when All India Congress Committee (AICC) leaders like Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi appeared before investigating agencies.

Stating that the TRS had lured legislators of other parties into its fold, the TPCC president said that now it is the turn of the ruling party in the State to face such a situation.

CLP leader Bhatti Vkiramarka led the agitation at Khammam Collectorate. He accused that farmers lost their rights with the implementation of Dharani, and about 12 lakh acres distributed to the poor was listed in Part B.

At Mahabunagar Collectorate, the programme was headed TPCC senior working president Mallu Ravi and DCC president Obeddula Kothval. Large number of party workers participated in the programme.

Nagarkurnool: Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy strongly objected to Jana Sena Party president and actor Pawan Kalyan’s statement that until former Chief Minister late NT Rama Rao came to power, people of Telangana could not enjoy a meal comprising rice. He advised the Jana Sena chief to first study history before making such sweeping remarks.

Niranjan Reddy stated that paddy cultivation was taken up in Telangana more than 1100-1200 years ago. He reminded that the rulers of Kakatiya and Reddy Raju dynasties had developed the chain of tanks in the region where paddy was cultivated abundantly. “Agriculture in Telangana was destroyed under the regime of Andhra rulers due to sheer discrimination and negligence.

Telangana: HC Junks Panchayat Resolution to Evict Tribal Community for Forest Ranger's Murder,"New Delhi: The Telangana high court on Tuesday, December 6, set aside a resolution passed by a village panchayat in the state’s Bhadradri-Kothagudem district that called for the eviction of the Gutti Koya tribal community.

Justice Lalitha Kanneganti questioned the authority of the Bendalapadu village gram panchayat in passing such orders. The resolution had called for ‘driving away’ Gutti Koyas to Chhattisgarh, from where they were forced to migrate in the mid-2000s because of the conflict between the state-sponsored Salwa Judum militia and Maoist groups.

The panchayat had passed the resolution in the wake of the killing of forest range officer Ch. Srinivasa Rao in the last week of November. Police had arrested two persons belonging to the Gutti Koya community in connection with the murder. The killing of the forest range officer has resulted in public opinion against the tribal community, and has also brought to the fore the festering issue of ‘podu cultivation’ locally.

Led by one Kavasi Hadma, a tribal, three members from the Gutti Koya community moved the high court, opposing the resolution.

According to The Hindu, the counsel for petitioners, Chikkudu Prabhakar, sought to know the law under which such a resolution was passed. He clarified that the police had already made arrests in connection with the murder, and there was no point in blaming the entire Gutti Koya community. He also submitted to the court that the Supreme Court had, in several earlier instances, reminded that panchayats do not have such power to issue eviction notices against anyone.

The petitioners said that the sarpanch and the panchayat secretary had passed the resolution even without conducting a gram panchayat.

The counsel for the petitioners argued that the eviction order violated the Panchayat Raj Act of 2018, Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers Recognition of Forest Rights Act 2006.

Although Telangana forest officials claim that the murder was due to disagreements between the forest officer and the accused over cattle grazing, it has brought to the fore the contentious ‘podu’ practice in Telangana once again.

Podu cultivation is a traditional form of agriculture that local communities practice in the Eastern Ghats and surrounding areas. As part of this, forests are cleared (often burned down) and people cultivate crops such as millets and vegetables in these patches.

After harvests, podu cultivators abandon the land and sometimes return to these patches two or three years later for another cropping season. A state government survey found that as many as 3.95 lakh farmers engaged in podu cultivation in Telangana, per a news report.

In a previous report, The Hindu had reported that the eviction notice passed by the panchayat claimed that the Gutti Koyas living in Errabodu are “addicted to ganja and liquor, and tote around fatal weaponry. They are losing discretion and committing murders. They are a threat to the lives of the people of Bendalapadu, who are forced to live in constant fear.”

Santhosh Esram, a social worker who runs a school for the Gutti Koya children in Mulugu district, told the newspaper that the community has “always remained reticent” and would flee into forests whenever they were approached by officials.

The report says that the Gutti Koya tribe started crossing over from Chhattisgarh around 2005 because they were caught in the crossfire between Salwa Judum and Maoists. “Far from threatening anybody, the Gutti Koya tribals are exploited by the native villagers in the name of land titles and borewells, as they lack state protections,” a researcher, who chose to remain anonymous, told The Hindu.",[],None,https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/16185558/dc-Cover-l81akaualvr7or9qm6bf27c0v3-20190829005553.Medi_-800x400.jpeg,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Suryapet', 'Wanaparthy', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"
Telangana: Forest Officer's Killing Brings to Fore Issue of Podu Cultivation Again,"Kochi: Two persons belonging to the Gutti Koya tribal community were arrested on November 23 in connection with the murder of a forest officer in Telangana’s Bhadradri Kothagudem district.

The murder occurred on November 22, allegedly over disagreements regarding cattle grazing in a forest plantation. Officials denied that the disagreements were over ‘podu’ land clearing by the people, as earlier reports claimed.

However, the murder has once again raised the issue of podu cultivation, a traditional form of shifting cultivation for which patches of forest land are cleared for agriculture, and the simmering discontent between the forest department and podu cultivators in the state.

Forest officer killed

Forty-two year old Chalamala Srinivas Rao, a Forest Range Officer (FRO), died on November 22 after sustaining injuries when members of the Gutti Koya tribal community attacked him.

As per several news reports, the attack occurred after Rao and another forest official tried to prevent the tribals from clearing forest land for ‘podu’.

However, as per recent reports, the spat that led to the murder was over disagreements in cattle grazing in a forest plantation, and not clearing of forest land for ‘podu’. The news agency PTI reported that two forest officials, including Rao, visited a plantation in Bendalapadu village in Chandrugonda mandal on Tuesday, after receiving information that the plantation – raised by the state Forest Department – was being damaged by cattle reared by members of the Gutti Koya community. An attack ensued when they tried to prevent the grazing.

Two members of the tribal community attacked the forest officials with axes. Rao, who could not get away in time, sustained grievous injuries on his head and neck and succumbed to his injuries en route to the hospital.

Rao, who won the KVS Babu state gold medal for forest protection in his range last year, was cremated with state honours on November 23. He is survived by his wife and two children. The Telangana state government announced ex-gratia of Rs 50 lakh to the family.

The controversial ‘podu’ issue

Though officials now claim that the murder was due to disagreements over cattle grazing, it has brought to the fore the contentious ‘podu’ practice in Telangana once again.

Podu cultivation is a traditional form of agriculture that local communities practice in the Eastern Ghats and surrounding areas. As part of this, forests are cleared (often burned down) and people cultivate crops such as millets and vegetables in these patches. After harvests, podu cultivators abandon the land and sometimes return to these patches two or three years later for another cropping season. A state government survey found that as many as 3.95 lakh farmers engaged in podu cultivation in Telangana, per a news report.

The forest department has raised concerns regarding the forest destruction and degradation, as well as resulting carbon emissions, that this kind of agriculture can cause. Ecologists have also said that though the practice of podu cultivation is “ecologically stable” in low population densities – when people practised it as a form of subsistence agriculture – the scale at which it is currently practised makes it more intensive and robs the soil of its fertility too.

The issue of ‘podu’ cultivation, therefore, has been a source of simmering discontent between local communities and the forest department in the state. Both forest officials and tribal communities have been hurt in several skirmishes and agitations surrounding podu agriculture over the years.

It is also a political issue, with numerous parties including the BJP taking up the issue against the K. Chandrashekar Rao government. Member of Parliament and chief of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee A. Revanth Reddy said on Wednesday that if chief minister KCR does not take immediate steps to issue guidelines for the allotment of podu land titles, his party would hold massive protests.

Tribal communities are eligible for title deeds to podu land they have settled on under the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, popularly known as the Forest Rights Act. However, much of this is yet to materialise. The Telangana government received 4.14 lakh claims from 2,845 gram panchayats when applications for titles were invited last year, reported The Hindu.

The moment we talk about podu, the Forest Department becomes the oppressor and the encroacher, the victim; but there are many layers to this, said wildlife conservationist Imran Siddiqui, who works in Telangana.

Many non-tribal people also clear forest lands and apply for claims over the ‘podu’ lands they have encroached upon, he said.

The implementation of the FRA in letter and spirit would ensure that the claims of “true local tribals” will be fulfilled, Siddiqui said. Others (including non-tribals) holding forest lands over a particular limit should be asked to surrender these patches for reforestation. Only then will the unabated felling of forests as part of podu cultivation will stop, he said.

“Illicit claims over forest land once regularised for political mileage will create more aspirants for regularisation in future,” he added.",[],None,https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/24192912/FiLFRHfVsAEOBtb-735x400.jpeg,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Suryapet', 'Wanaparthy', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"

"As Telangana claims it will revalidate cheques, farmers say, ‘help never came’","A day after the Telangana government said that directions have been issued to banks to revalidate some of the cheques distributed to farmers by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, their families on Friday said that they are yet to receive the cheques.

On May 22 this year, Rao had visited Chandigarh and distributed cheques of Rs 3 lakh each to the families of farmers in Punjab and Haryana who lost their lives during the agitation against the three farm laws. The cheques were to be encashed within the stipulated period of three months.

Telengana Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar said the state government had extended financial assistance to 709 families of deceased farmers.

The CM had distributed 1,010 cheques.

However, enquiry revealed that only 814 cheques were encashed and the rest were not. Following which, banks have now been asked to revalidate the cheques, said Kumar in a release on Thursday.

Farmers, however, said that around 500 cheques were to be distributed by the Telangana government but since it was getting late, it was announced that rest of the cheques will be sent to the respective district heads. “It’s been six months but some farmers are yet to get these cheques,”said Satnam Singh Behru, president of Indian farmers association (Punjab), adding that most families of farmers he met in November echoed the sentiment.

He added that so far five families from Tarn Taran have given their names. “Balwinder Kaur, the widow of Partap Singh of Kalsian Kalan village, Tarn Taran, told the union members that though she got the cheque, the bank is not encashing it and is also not telling her the reason. Families of Satnam Singh, Kulwant Singh, Malkit Singh, Fateh Singh and Jagbir Singh from Tarn Taran district had all attended the May 22 event but were told that DCs will send them the cheques,” Behru said, adding that they have informed the director of agriculture and an inquiry should be conducted into this.

Jagmohan Singh Dakaunda, general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), said that the Punjab government had submitted a list of 619 farmers to its Telangana counterpart. “Over 780 farmers died during the agitation against the three farm laws but the AAP government sent only 619 names. This shows their lack of governance. The agriculture department should at least get all the names verified as many families told us on November 26 that despite their names being on the list, they were yet to get the compensation,” he said.

When contacted, Punjab agriculture director Gurvinder Singh confirmed that farmers had approached him with the issue. “I had asked them to give me in writing but they never made the complaint official. In the absence of a written complaint, an inquiry cannot be conducted,” he said.

The Telangana government, however, said that a revenue department official has been entrusted with the job to help the beneficiaries. “We stand firmly with the families of these farmers in their moment of grief,” the Telangana government release read.","['Raakhi Jagga', 'Var Template_Content', 'Sso_Login_Box', 'Xwelcome Backorenter The Email Address Or Mobile Number Associated With Your Account To Sign In.

The capacity building programme was conducted at Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS) Palem in Nagarkurnool district.

The director general of ICRISAT, Dr Jacqueline Hughes said she was delighted with the collaboration with the government of Telangana and PJTSAU, which would likely see much-needed improvements to groundnut cultivation across the State, leading to improved farmer incomes while addressing scientists and farmers.



The DG further said, “we look forward to drawing upon the Institute’s experience and expertise in developing inclusive and sustainable seed systems and value chains to deliver to farmers across Telangana, high quality, accessible, and lower cost seed.”

Deputy director general of research at ICRISAT, Dr Arvind Kumar congratulated all parties for the initiative aimed at not only boosting incomes but incentivising new farmers to enter into groundnut production.



The ICRISAT and PJTSAU are taking up location-specific research, identification of genotypes, and multi-location trials of varieties developed by ICRISAT in order to deliver suitable varieties to Telangana and improve groundnut seed systems in the State.

"Higher education in T lacks vision to retain talent, save drain of resources","Hyderabad: Where is higher education in Telangana heading? This nagging question turns important as multiple visions and missions have been aired to take the State's higher education to the next level. The State government had claimed that it would focus on education and health after it successfully registered a lot of progress on the agriculture front.



Speaking to The Hans India, former vice-chancellor of a Telangana university said, ""A lot was expected with the formation of Telangana; but, most is confined to talking. One of the State ministers has claimed of having the vision to make Hyderabad and Telangana a knowledge hub.

Another minister talks about the vision to send out talent from Telangana to get jobs across the globe. Bureaucrats and some academicians' toeing the line of the powers that be are talking big about market-driven or market-demand courses,"" he added.

Said a top official who worked as a consultant to the State government's higher education initiatives, ""It is a popular view among the State varsity campuses that the initial buzz of KG to PG to push education to the next level is confined only to half-hearted initiatives. ""They could hardly pull the education sector from the existing academic, bureaucratic and policy hurdles."".

He added, ""It is not that the State has not done anything. But, whatever it had done in past eight years, the focus was more on what is visible than bringing substantial changes for good."" .

He pointed out that around two lakh students are going for higher education abroad from the country Students from the Telugu States have sizable numbers among them. It is expected to increase the outflow of around Rs 40,000 to 45,000 crore spent on students going abroad for education. At the national level it is estimated to touch around 2.7 percent of the gross domestic product.

Pointed out a senior official from the Higher Education department, Andhra Pradesh,

""It indicates that a sizable number of students go every year from the two Telugu States. The other side of the coin is that the State government and bureaucrats keep mum to the fact of increasing drain of talent and resources from the two States,""

Earlier, AP had tried to conduct a study to factor the scale and quantum of the knowledge economy that the State could create by improving the education sector. However, ""there is no such known study conducted in the case of Telangana. This, despite Hyderabad being one of the destinations for students from across the country to take admission in Central and national institutions,"" pointed out sources in the Telangana State Higher Education Department (TSHED).

""There is more rhetoric about the public policy on education as implementing things having a higher rate of visibility to increase the public perception remained a dominant factor. There is no focus on how to retain talent and invest it for the advancement of tate and save the increasing drain of resources from State,"" he said.",['Vrc Phaniharan'],2022-12-06 02:09:06+05:30,https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/12/05/1323571-edu.jpg,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Suryapet', 'Wanaparthy', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"
"Farmers in Andhra Pradesh are facing ‘untold hardships’ under YSRCP tenure, alleges TDP leader","December 04, 2022 07:44 pm | Updated 07:44 pm IST - NELLORE

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) Polit Bureau member Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy has alleged that farmers in Andhra Pradesh are facing untold hardship as the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government has ‘failed’ to come to their rescue.

‘‘The Agriculture Department is as good as closed in the State during the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s regime,” Mr. Chandramohan Reddy told the media on December 4 (Sunday).

He took strong exception to Agriculture Minister Kakani Govardhan Reddy’s suggestion to farmers to switch over from paddy to commercial crops including cotton and said that the government must intervene in the market to ensure the minimum support price (MSP) for the paddy farmers.

During the 2021-22 financial year, he said, the State Government had facilitated procurement of only 66 lakh tonnes of paddy when compared to 119 lakh tonnes procured of paddy growers in Telangana. In this context, he referred to a study conducted by the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) which had found that less number of farmers in Andhra Pradesh had got the MSP when compared to their counterparts elsewhere in the country.

‘’It is unfortunate that the YSRCP government is looking at paddy procurement as a burden on the exchequer. How can the Agriculture Minister ask farmers not to grow the staple crops especially those in the Godavari, Krishna and Penna delta regions?” said the TDP leader.

Cotton can be grown only in arid areas, not in the deltas, he explained, adding that cotton farmers were ‘forced to resort to extreme steps in the wake of highly volatile market condition and rampant pest attack’. He referred to high incidence of suicide among cotton farmers in Maharashtra and Telangana.

“The farmers are bearing the brunt of the faulty agriculture policies of the State government. Tomato growers in the State allowed their produce to perish in view of market crash. The onion growers from Kurnool are incurring losses,” said the TDP leader.

“Farmers who have switched to aquaculture are ruing their fate as they have no option but to declare a crop holiday for at least six months in the wake of traders driving down the prices due to global market condition,” the former Agriculture Minister said.

He said that soil testing and distribution of micro-nutrients to restore the soil health which was ‘proactively done’ during the erstwhile TDP regime had been discontinued now. “Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had promoted micro-irrigation systems and farm mechanisation in a big way. The farmers are now forced to run from pillar to post to get the drip irrigation system subsidy and farm equipment,” he charged.",[],2022-12-04 14:14:01+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/n7op83/article66223087.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/9775_4_12_2022_18_21_39_1_DSC_21.JPEG,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Suryapet', 'Wanaparthy', 'Krishna', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"
"Livestock, fisheries push agriculture GVA","A much reduced impact of monsoon rains on food grain and horticulture production and rapid expansion of livestock and fisheries sectors have sustained India’s growth in the agricultural and allied sector in the last decade. This is despite patchy and uneven performance of monsoon rains over the years.

The “agriculture and allied activities” clocked a robust growth in gross value added (GVA) of 4.6% at constant prices during the July-September period of 2022-23, which was even better than many analysts estimated, given the delayed monsoon and kharif sowing activities. The sector had grown at strong rate of 4.5% in the previous quarter too.

The high farm GVA growth was largely driven by better performance of “allied sectors” particularly livestock and fisheries.

According to official data, the livestock sector grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.15% over the five years ending 2019-20. In contrast, the production of rice, wheat and coarse cereals expanded at CAGRs of 2.7%, 2.9% and 4.8% respectively between 2015-16 to 2020-21. Production of horticultural crops — fruits, vegetables, plantation and spices which contribute a third of agriculture GVA, have witnessed a sustained growth in recent years. “Livestock sector growth has been sustained in the last decade, to a large extent insulated from the performance of monsoon,” CSC Sekhar, professor, Institute of Economic Growth, University of Delhi, told FE.

Sekhar, also the member of a panel set up by the agriculture ministry on minimum support price (MSP) said that while temporal distribution of monsoon rains has been patchy for many years, several regions have received adequate rainfall thus minimising its impact on agriculture. The share of the agriculture and allied sector in total gross value added (GVA) of the economy has been around 18% in the last decade with the exception of 2020-21 and 2021-22 when the share rose to 20.2% and 18.8% respectively.

The contribution of livestock and fisheries sectors in agricultural GVA have been rising while the share of the crop sector has declined (see chart).

According to an agriculture ministry official, the government’s procurement of rice and wheat is carried out mostly in those states such as Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana which mostly have irrigation facilities thus minimising impact of deficient monsoon rains.

The MSP of paddy and wheat has been consistently rising at slightly higher than earlier in recent years thanks to the policy of cost-plus-50% returns ensured since 2019-20 marketing year. Also, with the exception of the current rabi marketing year (April-June) when wheat procurement dropped sharply, MSP purchases from the farmers have been around 60 million tonne (MT) annually.

India’s food grain production fell 5% to 252 MT in 2104-15 crop year (July-June) compared to previous year, while monsoon was 12% below the normal benchmark. However, there was no significant fall in foodgrain output in 2018-19, while monsoon rainfall was 9% lower than than normal benchmark.

S Mahendra Dev, former chairman of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) also said that even in case of deficient monsoon rains, several regions do receive adequate rainfall thus minimising impact of monsoon on agriculture sector.

“Livestock sector, especially dairy and fisheries, have been witnessing a sustained growth rate irrespective of monsoon performance because of rising demand and improvement in the value chain,” Dev said.

Stating that livestock and fisheries have been experiencing buoyant growth and has helped the agricultural sector perform well, the economic survey (2021-22) has noted that in 2018-19, the growth in the agriculture was buoyed by the performance of livestock and fisheries even though the growth of GVA for crops contracted 1.6%.",['Sandip Das'],None,https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-106.jpg,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Suryapet', 'Wanaparthy', 'Krishna', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"

Telangana: Irregularities in Dalit Bandhu scheme found by FFGG,"Hyderabad: Anti-corruption NGO Forum For Good Governance (FFGG) here wrote to Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) asking him to evaluate the state government’s Dalit Bandhu scheme. FFGG members, who undertook a study of their own at Vasalamarri village, which KCR adopted, reportedly found irregularities in the programme.

From improperly identifying activities to other issues, the organisation said that Dalit Bandhi beneficiaries even sold their assets eventually in some cases.

In the letter addressed to KCR on Monday, FFGG secretary Padmanabh Reddy said that the general talk in Vasalamarri is that the Dalit Bandhu scheme is being “cornered by ruling party workers”. Under the Dalit Bandhu scheme, launched by KCR in the run up to the Huzurabad bypoll last year, the state government is giving Dalit beneficiaries Rs 10 lakh (investments into businesses of their choice) to uplift them.

It was launched with a lot of fanfare as a revolutionary scheme for Dalits, who are marginalised, to help them socially and monetarily. However, FFGG, which undertook its own study of the scheme in Vasalamarri village (Turkapally mandal), said that even a year after it was launched no tangible results can be seen.

According to FFGG’s study, Vasalamarri village has a population of 1763, of which 249 people are Dalits, totaling to 52 families. Padmanabh Reddy said more than one beneficiary per family was chosen as a total of 75 persons were chosen for the Dalit Bandhu scheme.

‘Impact of Dalit Bandhu not visible on ground’

“The activities taken up are agriculture 12 units, poultry 14, dairy 6, sheep 7, transport 16, ration shops etc 17, others 3. Easy to pick and choose method was adopted and the activities selected are mostly goods vehicles and dozers. The beneficiaries being women, in most of the cases the beneficiary or other male member of the family are not having license to drive, as such they are forced to engage a driver leading to cost escalation and subsequently some have disposed the assets,” said Padmanabh Reddy about some of the irregularities with Dalit Bandhu.

The FFGG secretary further claimed that out of Rs 7.5 crore released by the Telangana government in Visalamarri village, so far close to Rs 6.5 crore has been released to Dalit Bandhu beneficiaries. Padmanabh Reddy said that except for a few exceptions, the impact of Dalit Bandhu scheme is not visible on the ground. Similarly in Karimnagar district, he said that 18 beneficiaries were chosen from three families.

“In Vaddepally village of Kamareddy district, 3 Family members of a family got 30 lakhs under Dalita Bandhu. With this money, they purchased a harvester and after a month sold it away at throwaway price. There was a quarrel and distribution of money which led to murder of one of the beneficiaries,” said Padmanabh Reddy’s letter to KCR on the issue.

He pointed out that in a case of interference by the local MLA, the mater went to the High Court, which directed the district collector to choose beneficiaries as per the guidelines.",['Yunus Lasania'],2022-11-28 14:36:57+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/httpswww.canva_.comdesignDAE5uz0Olmk2Jr5tDLfTNsRFtlUBeys2Qedit-13.png,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Suryapet', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Krishna', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"

The plant load factor of 73.87% achieved by the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Limited (TS-Genco) for 2021-22 was highest in the country as the all India average was 56.5%.

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Chairman of TSERC T. Sriranga Rao said: “Telangana Discoms are the best in consumer service by providing 24X7 reliable power supply and developing consumer- friendly mobile app”.

As per the ARRs submitted by the Discoms, the industrial and commercial sales of energy are expected to increase by 13.75% and 15.07%, respectively, in 2023-24 in view of the increase in investments in these sectors across Telangana. Telangana is the only State which is supplying 24x7 reliable power to all categories of consumers including agriculture, Mr. Sriranga Rao said.

Further, the benefits extended by the State Government to different sections of consumers, including 24X7 free power to agricultural pumpsets benefiting 27.62 lakh consumers, free power supply up to 101 units per month to SC and ST domestic consumers, free power supply up to 250 units per month to hair cutting salons run by ‘Nayee Brahmins’ and laundries run by washermen and concession of ₹2 per unit to power looms, poultry farms and spinning mills would continue as per the ARRs, the TSERC Chairman added.",[],2022-11-30 18:29:42+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Suryapet', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Krishna', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"

Hyderabad: ICRISAT has developed a mobile gaming app name MRIDA (Managing resources for integrated development of agriculture) to help smallholder farmers strategise climate-smart agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon that eventually increases yield and builds resilience.

“We are happy to partner with GIZ in bringing user-friendly technology that not only educates farmers on soil conservation but also captures farmers’ attitude to soil management practices in the face of climate change, providing valuable insights to policymakers and governments,” said Dr. Jacqueline Hughes, Director General, ICRISAT.

A team of scientists from the international organisation undertook a modelling study from 2020 to 2022 conducted in five districts of Maharashtra and eight districts of Odisha to develop the app, which promotes behavioural change for adopting climate-smart agriculture practices among farmers.

It was developed with funds sanctioned by the German Agency for International Cooperation to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of agriculture management to determine their potential to sequester carbon (the process of capturing, securing, and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide from the atmosphere)

In addition to English, the gaming app that was developed, in collaboration with Vasudhaika Software Private Limited, will soon be available in Marathi.

“The game app will sensitise farmers on four key elements – fertilizer, crop selection, biochar application, and irrigation. Based on the season, they can make their selections and ascertain organic carbon and yield output. The recommendations will help them make better on-farm decisions,” said Dr. ML Jat, Global Research Program Director, Resilient Farm and Food Systems, ICRISAT.

TRS grabbing farmers’ lands through Dharani: Congress’ Shabbir Ali,"Kamareddy: Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) PAC convener Mohammed Ali Shabbir has accused the TRS Government of illegally grabbing farmers’ land in the name of the Dharani portal.

He was addressing a massive dharna at the Kamareddy Collectorate on Monday as part of the Congress party’s State-wide agitation demanding the cancellation of the Dharani portal, waiver of crop loans and resolution of the Podu lands issue.

The Congress leader alleged that Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) was using Dharani as a tool to grab farmers’ land for his family and friends. He said complaints involving nearly 30 lakh acres of land have arisen after the introduction of Dharani.

“KCR government is snatching away prime parcels of land by placing them under the prohibited zone. Those pieces of land are being sold to private companies in open auctions. Else, members of the KCR family are indirectly selling those lands to private parties. Congress party will not tolerate this injustice to farmers and will fight till Dharani is cancelled,” he announced.

Shabbir Ali also slammed the TRS Govt for not fulfilling its promise of waiving crop loans up to Rs 1 lakh. He said despite completing nearly four years in the second term, the government did not waive off crop loans. He demanded that sufficient funds should be allocated in the ensuing budget to waive off all crop loans in a single take.

He further demanded that the state government place the Agriculture Action Plan in the public domain and provide the necessary guidance, quality seeds and fertilizers and other facilities to the farmers. He said CM KCR should give an assurance to farmers that the State Government would procure their entire produce.

The Congress leader also demanded immediate resolution of the Podu lands issue. He said that the TRS created an unnecessary rift between the Tribals and Forest officials by creating a controversy over Podu lands. He said TRS was responsible for the murder of a forest officer in Kothagudem. He demanded that the State Government restore the rights of Tribals over forest land to put an end to the Podu land issue.",['News Desk'],2022-12-05 15:59:40+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Shabbir.jpg,[],[],,"['Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Suryapet', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Krishna', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar']"
"Villages bordering TS, Maharashtra in fear over tiger attacks","Tigers are entering villages on either side of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve and Tipeshwar Tiger Reserve. (By arrangement)

Adilabad: People in the bordering villages of Telangana and Maharashtra are gripped by fear of tiger attacks after a second incident took place at Anandguda in Lakkadkot gram panchayat -- in Rajura taluk of Maharashtra.

Two separate incidents of tiger(s) killing -- of two adivasi farmers -- took place on the state’s borders in the last 19 days.

Farmer Kursenga Jangu, 60, was killed in Anandguda on Dec 3. In nearby Khanapur of Wankidi mandal in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district, farmer Sidam Bheem had been killed on Nov.15.

In the latest incident, the farmer was picking the cotton yield. He went inside the fields after hearing some strange noises. His family members later found the body of the Kursenga Jangu.

Anandguda village headman Gedam Raghunath said farmers have stopped going to the agriculture fields for cotton-picking. The village is 4km away from the Telangana border.

“Another tiger attack took place 15 days ago in Viroor. A farmer was killed. The forest staff set up camera traps to track the tiger movement,” he said.

The tiger dragged the body of the farmer some 15 meters inside the field after killing him. Workers picking cotton in the same field heard the roar of the tiger.

Both movement of tigers and their number have increased on the borders of Telangana and Maharashtra in recent times. These tigers are entering villages on either side of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve and Tipeshwar Tiger Reserve.

Meanwhile, forest staff found the carcass of four adult cubs in the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve on December 4. The cause of their death was not clear.

It is suspected that the tiger that killed the farmer in Wankidi on the Telangana border was the same that killed the farmer on the Maharashtra border.

There are rumours a few tigers have become man-eaters and are actively moving along the state borders and attacking humans, mainly the farmers working in the cotton fields as this is the cotton-picking season.

Forest guard Sumedh Sinde of Viroor forest range in Maharashtra said the tiger that attacked the farmer in Anandguda was not a man-eater and the pug marks of tigers involved in the Khanapur and Anandguda incidents did not match.

He said the Maharashtra government has increased the compensation to Rs 20 lakh from Rs 15 lakh to families of those killed in tiger attacks. This decision was taken after Sudhir Mungantiwar took charge of the state forest ministry. The Telangana government is giving only Rs 5 lakh as compensation to such families.",[],2022-12-05 00:07:00+05:30,https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-ul6au9gkoi901e6lvordvgacv0-20210729082810.Medi.jpeg,[],[],,"['Asifabad', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Kothagudem', 'Wankidi', 'Vikarabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Suryapet', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khanapur', 'Krishna', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"

PM Kisan: 6.65 Lakh Farmers Missed Benefits of the Scheme; Know Why?,"The Central government is most likely to release the next instalment of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana in December hence it has asked all the beneficiaries to update their e-KYC by 15 December.

Latest update on PM Kisan: The Central government had asked all the beneficiaries of PM Kisan to update their e-KYC or else they may not get the benefits of the scheme.

As per media reports, as many as 6.65 lakh farmers in Telangana did not receive the financial assistance under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana due to failure in updating the e-KYC (know your customer).

The reasons for not updating the e-KYC were lack of awareness among the beneficiaries and carelessness of the agriculture department in ensuring that farmers complete their details.

Sources told media that the procedure to update e-KYC rules was simple. Beneficiaries just had to provide their Aadhaar details and mobile phone numbers and link them to complete the eKYC process online.

In Telangana, about 70 lakh farmers get the benefit of Rythu Bandhu scheme, only 32.72 lakh farmers received the 12th instalment of PM Kisan yojana in October.

Total, 39,38,432 farmers have applied for the scheme but around 6.65 lakh farmers could not get Rs 133 crore due to non-updation of e-KYC.

PM Kisan 13th Installment Date

The Central government is most likely to release the next instalment of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana by the end of December or in early January. Hence it has asked all the beneficiaries to update their e-KYC by 15 December.

According to official sources, less than 60% of the farmers had completed their e-KYC. As now only 9 days are left, it is feared that lakhs of beneficiaries could lose this benefit again.

If you too haven’t updated the e-KYC then immediately do it or else you may be deprived of the benefits of PM Kisan scheme. To update e-KYC – either go to the official website or visit nearest CSC centre.

Telangana nudging farmers to shift to oil palm: Minister KT Rama Rao,"Telangana nudging farmers to shift to oil palm: Minister KT Rama Rao

Over the next five years, effort will be to convert 20 lakh acre paddy systemically towards oil palm with support and guidance from the Government, said IT and Industries Minister KT Rama Rao.

By Telangana Today Updated On - 03:45 PM, Fri - 18 November 22

Hyderabad: Telangana Government is asking the farmers to move away from paddy cultivation and opt for oil palm and oil seed cultivation. This will help in reducing the import dependence for edible oils and also protect the farmers from the glut in the paddy production. Over the next five years, effort will be to convert 20 lakh acre paddy systemically towards oil palm with support and guidance from the Government, said IT and Industries Minister KT Rama Rao.

Speaking at the global roundtable organised by the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers Association, he said the State has worked meticulously on the Kaleshwaram project and this has added over 40 lakh acre command area (the extent of the area which can be reliably irrigated from an irrigation source). The area under cultivation more than doubled in Telangana in seven years. The paddy production has now touched 25.9 million metric tonne (MT) in the State from the earlier 6.8 million MT, recording a close to four-fold increase. The production has resulted in the Food Corporation of India expressing its helplessness in procuring additional stocks.

The Telangana Government has decided to increase the production of oil palm, groundnut, sunflower, soybean and other oil seeds.These will also contribute to the self-sufficiency of the nation and aid in cutting down the edible oil import bill. These will also serve as the raw materials for edible oil units that come up in the State, which successfully managed to increase its green cover to 31.7% from the earlier 24%.

Increasing domestic production is more important than ever before as the world population has crossed 800 crore and India, after China, is the most populous nation. The consumption patterns will change with the increase in population, he said.

Pitching Telangana as an ideal investment destination to the members of the Vegetable Oil Producers Association, Rama Rao said the State will offer tailor-made incentives based on the investment proposals. The State has also earmarked about 10,000 acre for the special food processing zones that the State is planning. Telangana will meet or beat the offerings from other States. The industrial approvals in the State are through the single window system TS-iPASS, which so far has issued 20,000 approvals worth $ 35 billion and created employment to 16 lakh people.

Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy said about 220 million tonne edible oil was needed every year to feed the global population. The demand in India was about 22 million tonne but the domestic production was about 10 to 12 million and the remaining deficit was met through imports. An estimated Rs 90,000-1,00,000 crore was spent by the country in importing the edible oils, of which palm oil accounted for about 67%.

The per capita consumption of edible oil was 19 kg. With a huge deficit in demand, it was important for the country to look for ways to be self-sufficient. Telangana identified the importance and potential of this and has drawn out a plan to support oil palm in about 20 lakh acre in the long term. About 40,000 acre has been achieved so far of the targeted 1.75 lakh acre this year. Contribution of Telangana will be significant at the national level aiding to cut the import bill. Agriculture and allied activities continue to provide large scale employment in the State.",['Telangana Today'],2022-11-18 15:43:23+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Telangana-nudging-farmers-to-shift-to-oil-palm-Minister-KT-Rama-Rao.jpg,[],[],,"['Asifabad', 'Hayathnagar', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Kothagudem', 'Wankidi', 'Vikarabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Suryapet', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khanapur', 'Krishna', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Chandrugonda']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"
"PM Narendra Modi dedicates new railway line in Telangana, built at cost of over Rs 1,000 crore","During his visit to Telangana on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Bhadrachalam Road- Sattupalli train line, which cost about Rs 1000 crore to build. Additionally, to boost the state's infrastructural development, PM Modi also laid the cornerstone for other road projects totaling more than Rs 2200 crores, including the Medak-Siddipet-Elkathurthy portion of NH-765DG, the Bodhan-Basar-Bhainsa section of NH-161BB, and the Sironcha to Mahadevpur stretch of NH-353C.

The ceremony also involved the dedication of the Ramagundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (RFCL) plant during the second of his two-day visit to the southern states. Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for Ramagundam Project on August 7, 2016. The driving force behind the revival of the Fertilizer Plant is the vision of the Prime Minister to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of urea.

The Ramagundam Plant will make available 12.7 LMT per annum of indigenous neem-coated Urea. The project has been set up under the aegis of Ramagundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (RFCL), which is a Joint Venture Company of National Fertilizers Limited (NFL), Engineers India Ltd (EIL) and Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited (FCIL). RFCL was entrusted with the responsibility of setting up the New Ammonia-Urea Plant with an investment of more than Rs. 6300 crores.

Gas to RFCL Plant will be supplied through Jagdishpur - Phulpur- Haldia Pipeline. The Plant would ensure an adequate and timely supply of urea fertilizer to the farmers in the state of Telangana as well as in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Chattisgarh, and Maharashtra.

The Plant would not only improve the availability of fertilizer but will also boost overall economic development in the region, including the development of infrastructures like roads, railways, ancillary industry, etc.

Apart from this, the region will benefit from the development of MSME vendors for the supply of various goods for the factory. RFCL`s `Bharat Urea` is expected to provide a tremendous boost to the economy by not only reducing imports but also giving an impetus to the local farmers through a timely supply of fertilizers and extension services.

During his address, PM Modi said, ""The Rs 10000 Crores worth of development projects are going to boost Telangana's agriculture & business climate. During the ongoing global crisis, global experts agree, India is moving in the direction of becoming 3rd biggest economy in the world.""

Why DBT schemes need to fix the problem of tenant farmers,"Most economists advocate the conversion of all agricultural subsidies — whether on inputs (supplying fertiliser, power, water at below cost) or outputs (procuring crops at above market prices) — into direct income support to farmers.

Such support, in the form of direct benefit transfers (DBT) on a per-acre or per-farmer basis, is seen as transparent and simple to administer. Moreover, it is crop-neutral (only rice, wheat and sugarcane farmers effectively get minimum support prices now) and does not cause distortions in input/output markets.

Must Read | How Direct Benefit Transfer scheme has transformed social welfare in India

However, there is one limitation with the present agri-DBT schemes, such as the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan), the Telangana government’s Rythu Bandhu and Andhra Pradesh’s YSR Rythu Bharosa — they do not reach tenant farmers, i.e. those who undertake cultivation on leased land.

Left-out beneficiaries

PM-Kisan provides an annual income support of Rs 6,000 to all landholding farmer families in India. Rythu Bandhu extends financial assistance of Rs 10,000 per acre, again to all farmers owning land and without any size limit. Under YSR Rythu Bharosa, farmer families are paid Rs 13,500 per year, which includes Rs 6,000 through PM-Kisan and the AP government’s top-up of Rs 7,500.

The exclusion of tenant farmers — from income support and also zero/low-interest loans, crop insurance, disaster compensation and other agri-related schemes — is significant, given the rising trend of owners no longer directly cultivating their lands.

According to the National Statistical Office’s (NSO) ‘Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households’ survey for 2018-19, 17.3 per cent out of the total estimated 101.98 million operational holdings (i.e. farms) in rural India were on leased lands. The share of such leased-in lands in the total area used for agricultural production was 13 per cent. The NSO’s previous surveys for 2012-13 and 2002-03 revealed the shares of leased-in holdings at only 13.7 per cent (11.3 per cent of area) and 9.9 per cent (6.5 per cent), respectively.

State-wise tenancy

Table 1 shows the incidence of non-owners cultivating agricultural lands to be the highest for Andhra Pradesh (AP) (42.4 per cent) and Odisha (39 per cent). In Haryana and Punjab, the share of leased-in area is higher than the percentage of tenant holdings. It means that the tenant farmers there operate relatively large holdings, even though they don’t own these lands.

While the NSO surveys point to a steady increase in tenant farmers — who typically pay fixed cash rents or share of produce to owners — these would, perhaps, be underestimates: farm tenancy agreements are largely oral, unwritten contracts and seldom recorded leases.

Must Read | Why agrarian reforms should go beyond meeting demands of the agitating farmers

The NSO data for Telangana, for instance, shows 17.5 per cent of holdings in the state to be cultivated under lease. But a survey of 7,744 farmers across 34 village gram panchayats in 20 districts reckons the figure close to 35.6 per cent. “One can safely assume that at least 30 per cent of Telangana’s farmers today are tenants,” said Kiran Kumar Vissa, co-founder of Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), a Hyderabad-based sustainable agriculture organisation that conducted the survey during May-June 2022.

The Telangana government has budgeted Rs 14,800 crore for Rythu Bandhu in 2022-23. To the extent this money is being credited to the accounts of non-cultivating landowners, it is depriving the real “rythu” or farmer.

Exclusion errors

A better idea of the costs of exclusion can be had from AP, probably India’s most DBT-advanced state. Between June 2019 and October 2022, the government of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has transferred over Rs 176,500 crore to some 7.37 crore people under 26 DBT schemes. These – mainly named after himself or his late father YS Rajasekhara Reddy – target not just farmers, but also women, senior citizens, schoolchildren, unorganised workers and specific communities such as Kapus and weavers (Table 2).

RSV, during January-February 2022, did a survey of 3,855 tenant farmers in 31 gram panchayats across nine AP districts.

The AP government’s agri-DBT schemes such as YSR Rythu Bharosa, Free Crop Insurance, Input Subsidy and Sunna Vaddi (zero-interest loans) technically also cover tenant farmers. The Jagan government enacted the AP Crop Cultivator Rights law in August 2019. It provides for the issuance of “crop cultivator rights cards (CCRC)” to persons cultivating the lands of owners under agreements with 11-month validity, and countersigned by the village revenue officers concerned. The cards entitle lessee cultivators to benefits under the state’s DBT schemes, besides being “sufficient” for obtaining crop loans from banks.

But the RSV study found just 364 out of the 3,855 tenant farmers — identified through door-to-door surveys in each of the selected villages — to have received CCRCs. Even out of the 364 card holders, only 63 had got Rythu Bharosa benefits and 12 availed bank loans on their leased lands.

“The CCRC requires the landowner’s signature and cannot be issued without his consent. Most owners are hesitant to sign any document confirming they have given their lands on lease. They fear that any written agreement makes them vulnerable to lawsuits by tenants claiming rights over the land. Also, what if the tenants take loans against CCRCs and the repayment burden falls on the owners? The new law’s provisions that prevent banks from attaching the owner’s land for any dues of the cultivator don’t seem to make a difference,” pointed out Vissa.

Fixing the tenant problem

AP’s experience holds lessons for DBT, more so when it applies to agriculture. Both AP and Telangana have been trailblazers as far as direct income support to farmers goes. But neither has been able to crack the tenant conundrum.

Agriculture in India is increasingly seeing both “tenancy” (landless/marginal farmers leasing in land to cultivate) and “reverse tenancy” (small landowners leasing out to better-off farmers keen to reap economies of scale). This is natural, as not everyone – including those owning land – may be good at or wants to farm. Farming might ultimately become a specialised enterprise. Leasing can help both tenant and reverse-tenant farmers operate consolidated holdings, while allowing owners to take up non-agricultural employment without risking loss of their lands.

The Narendra Modi government, assuming it returns for a third term at the Centre in 2024, may well seek to expand PM-Kisan’s scale and scope.

Wanaparthy: Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy said Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao’s vision and commitment to complete all pending irrigation projects and distribution of free fish seedlings had aided in employment and livelihood opportunities for the fishermen’s community in the State.

In the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, fishermen were neglected, forcing many to migrate to other places for a livelihood. However after the formation of Telangana, the Chief Minister had envisioned Mission Kakatiya and filled up all water tanks in the State, Niranjan Reddy said after releasing fish seedlings in Ranga Samudram at Srirangapur mandal here on Thursday.

Pointing out that Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, 24 hour free power supply and provision of sufficient water had instilled new confidence among farmers in the State, he said Telangana’s welfare and development programmes were a role model to the entire country. The Centre and other State governments were replicating these programmes by coining different names, he added.

Apart from livelihood opportunities for the fishermen’s community, the move to release fish seedlings has also aided in ensuring availability of nutritional food to residents in villages, he said. Distribution of sheep under subsidy to beneficiaries has also helped in the economic welfare of the Golla Kuruma community, he said, adding that the Chief Minister had infused fresh lease of life into traditional occupations in the State.",['Telangana Today'],2022-11-17 14:19:46+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/niranjan-reddy.jpg,[],[],,"['Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"

SC agreeing to an inquiry into ‘compelling reasons’ for allowing GM crops does not augur well for agriculture

Science alone should guide the policies on adoption of new crop technologies. Unfortunately, in India, the public discourse on genetically modified technologies is often clouded by politics, delusional activism and fear-mongering. Matters that must be decided by evidence-based science are often hijacked by alarmist ideologies that manufacture fear to block introduction of new technologies. Even after the country’s biotech regulator has cleared the introduction of genetically modified mustard after prolonged scrutiny, the matter has been pushed into litigation now. It would have been prudent if the Supreme Court kept itself away from scrutinising the issue of GM mustard. The apex court agreeing to an inquiry into “compelling reasons” for allowing GM crops does not augur well for the well-established policy of using modern technologies to improve crop production and productivity. The government has already examined the matter thoroughly at different levels based on hard scientific data. Climate change will require the development of seeds that can withstand the vagaries of temperature and precipitation. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has approved the GM mustard, developed by Delhi University, and recommended its release into the market. The government should not lose an opportunity to take the benefits of science to the farmers. There should be no dilly-dallying on the matter because the country’s agriculture sector cannot prosper without science and technology. The introduction of GM mustard will serve the public interest at multiple levels. India imports 60% of its edible oil needs, amounting to $19 billion annually, and a fraction of this is GM soya bean oil.

The transgenic mustard has the potential to be a game-changer for India in terms of boosting production and productivity of the oilseed and reducing dependence on the import of edible oil. Both consumers of this GM oil and exporter countries growing this crop have faced no problems whatsoever. The ICAR trials show that GM mustard’s yields are 28% higher than the domestic variety. The GM mustard would not need additional inputs of water, fertilizers or pesticides, thereby translating into more yield at a lower cost. It is also the result of publicly funded R&D, debunking the usual conspiracy theories. Since India is looking to increase oilseeds output under its Aatmanirbhar campaign, promoting GM mustard will go a long way in furthering this cause. The approvals for GM crops follow multiple studies proving their safety and efficacy and stringent government scrutiny. While there still exists ideological or political opposition to GM foods in some quarters, courts are certainly not the forums to resolve such debates. The executive must be able to formulate policies on such matters without being hassled by unnecessary litigation. In 2004, India allowed commercial cultivation of GM cotton, a non-food crop. Its rapid adoption has helped the country to move from a net importer to a large exporter. This can be replicated in oilseeds as well.",['Telangana Today'],2022-12-05 00:25:58+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cropped-android-chrome-512x512-1-267x267-2.png,[],[],,"['Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"
"Govt likely to allocate Rs 15,500 crore for crop insurance for FY24","The Union Budget is likely to allocate around Rs 15,500 crore for the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) for next financial year same as the budget estimate for 2022-23, despite a spike in expenses.

Sources said the anticipated expenses for the centre for implementation of PMFBY in current fiscal would be around Rs 19,000 crore against the budget estimate of Rs 15,500 crore, while there are around Rs 6000 crore of ‘unspent balance’ in the corpus of the scheme from the previous year.

“With a similar level of allocation for 2023-24 like the current fiscal, it would be adequate for implementation of the crop insurance scheme,” an official told FE.

The premium to be paid by farmers under the crop insurance scheme is fixed at just 1.5% of the sum insured for rabi crops and 2% for kharif crops, while it is 5% for cash crops.

The balance premium is equally shared among the Centre and states, which implies they bear most of the premium under the scheme. In the case of the north-eastern states, the premium is split between the Centre and states in a 9:1 ratio.

PMFBY is currently being implemented in 21 states/union territories. Ten insurance companies both the public and private sectors, are implementing the crop insurance scheme.

In the last six years, Rs 25,186 crore have been paid by farmers as the premium, wherein Rs 1.26 trillion have been paid to the farmers against their claims as on October 31, 2022, according to an agriculture ministry statement last week.

States such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Gujarat had dropped out of the scheme because of the high costs. However, Andhra Pradesh re-joined the crop insurance scheme from kharif 2022. Officials said that talks are on with Telangana and Jharkhand, who are expected to re-join the scheme soon. Talks with the Gujarat government for implementation of PMFBY will be held after the new government takes office in the state.

Punjab, which has not adopted the crop scheme launched in 2016, is in discussion with the agriculture ministry to launch the scheme from kharif 2023 in the state.

Meanwhile , the government would soon introduce restructured PMFBY for expanding the base of insurance coverage amongst farmers and ensure quick settlements of claims.",['Sandip Das'],None,https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-121.jpg,[],[],,"['Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"

This FPO in MP Making Women Farmers Visible Face of Agriculture,"Shivpuri, Dec 6 (PTI) Breaking barriers, women farmers from 16-odd villages in this district, who were facing a lot of hardship and not getting recognition of their labour at home and in the farm field, have now set up an all-female farmer producers company to collectively buy inputs and market their crops.

The 'Shipre Farmer Producer Company Ltd (SFPCL)' with 650-odd members from 16 active villages was established on November 25, 2021 after three years of training and support under a CSR programme.

In 2019, multinational alcohol beverage company Pernod Ricard India had launched CSR programme 'Water, Agriculture and Livelihood (WAL)' in partnership with local NGO SRIJAN (Self-Reliant Initiatives through Joint Action).

""We started the WAL initiative primarily to cater to the scheduled tribes (ST) and scheduled caste (SC) population which did not have access to water. The first aspect was to get these farmers to take a second crop. We helped them to get water by constructing ponds, Doha structures, etc. so that they harness water,"" Sashidhar Vempala, CSR and Sustainability Head at Pernod Ricard India told PTI.

The second aspect was helping farmers understand how multi-cropping will increase their income and improve their lives. They were encouraged to form Self Help Groups (SHGs), Women Producer Groups (WPGs) and then a farmer producer company (FPO) to take advantage of collective effort, he said.

""It is not just about increasing disposable income and livelihood, it is also about getting women out of the four walls and making them part of the development of a local ecosystem. That's why WAL went beyond water, agriculture and livelihood into an ecosystem of rural development,"" Vempala added.

Under the WAL programme, 92 ponds, one each of pond-like structure called 'Doha' model and check dam, were built in most-water stressed areas in 11 villages, according to SRIJAN Team Lead Sharique Mahmood.

Women farmers were taught about the importance of multi-cropping; good agricultural practices like line-seeding and natural farming; post-harvest practices like grading besides marketing, Mahmood added.

Sharing her success story, a woman farmer belonging to Sahariya tribe in Naguli village, Rukma Adivasi (45), said: ""I used to grow groundnut and urad with the help of monsoon rains in kharif season and migrate for work during the rabi season. A pond has been dug in the field and with that water I have been growing rabi crops wheat and gram for the last three years.""

Ramvathi Kewat (40), another woman farmer from Naguli village, too is taking two crops thanks to construction of a 'Doha' structure along the (nala) stream. This kind of structure helps arrest flow of water during monsoon, thus creating additional water potential.

Both Kewat and Adivasi have stopped migrating for work to Indore, Gwalior, Agra and other cities in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Now, they sell their produce to the FPO.

Some of the women farmers have started doing line-seeding, adopting multi-cropping methods and new farm practices including natural farming.

""After shifting to natural farming, I have stopped using chemical fertilisers like urea and DAP. I make my own vermicompost and jeevamrutha (natural liquid fertilizer). The fertiliser cost has reduced and I am getting better rate selling through our FPO,"" says Leelavati Pal from Barodi village, a member of SFPCL.

With these learnings, some of the women farmers have emerged as crucial drivers of change and become the board of directors at SFPCL.

According to Bharati Lodi (21), a woman farmer from Sirsona village and a board of director in SFPCL, says, ""Earlier, I used to work in the farm field with my husband, but was never involved in the farming related decisions. After getting the training in good agricultural practices, my husband acknowledges my knowledge.""

Anguri Lodi (32) who is in-charge of a village collection centre in Barodi village for SFPCL, says, ""We never knew the price was determined by size and quality of the grain. We learnt this and now use machines to grade the produce scientifically and accordingly fix the price. This was an eye opener for us.""

With collective procurement, the FPO has been able to trade in volume and negotiate better rates. The FPO now gets mandi auction rates through SMS, she added.

Groundnut and phalas (non-timber forest produce) were two crops sold through the FPO in the kharif season, while mustard and wheat during rabi season.

The male farmers of the family have realised the benefits of this new knowledge and have started respecting the women and acknowledging their contribution in agriculture.

Now, SFPCL is confident of operating on its own as Pernod Ricard India has made an exit from its CSR initiative from this district early this year.

The central government has launched a scheme to establish 10,000 new FPOs in the country with a budgetary provision of Rs 6,865 crore.

HYDERABAD: Are you a student who’s finding it difficult to study Chemistry in order to get admission into a BTech course? Are you spending sleepless nights over Mathematics because you want to pursue a degree in Agriculture? These worries may soon be a thing of the past as an official committee constituted by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) will soon submit a report to the State government on how to implement the revised rules of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

The AICTE had issued revised rules for admission into BTech and other degree courses and released an Approval Process Handbook. According to the AICTE’s revised rules, it isn’t necessary to study Chemistry in Intermediate to get an admission into BTech. There is no need to study Mathematics to get an admission in Agriculture course after taking on the EAMCET.

Likewise, studying Physics and Chemistry is not a must to be in a B-Planning course, according to the latest rules of AICTE. AICTE issued revised rules as a part of the National Education Policy (NEP).

“We constituted a committee recently to look into the revised rules of AICTE. The committee will submit a report on this shortly. Based on the report, the TSCHE will submit the proposals to the State government,” TSCHE chairman Prof R Limbadri told TNIE on Friday. If the State government follows the revised rules, then more number of students will become eligible to study engineering courses.

To align itself with the AICTE’s guidelines, the TSCHE held a meeting on Thursday. However, at present only one group of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry (MPC) is available at the Inter level. If the State government makes any changes for admissions into engineering courses, then some changes need to be made at the Inter level as well. Some new subject combinations at Inter level are required.

Medak MP Kotha Prabhakar Reddy is presenting Rs 50,000 cash to Sravanthi at her house.

Siddipet: Medak MP Kotha Prabhakar Reddy has come to the rescue of Gollachinnolla Sravanthi, who secured the 3rd rank in HORTICET-2022 but was in dilemma unable to pay Rs.50,000 at the time of admission to the Horticulture University.

Following a news report on Sravanthi’s plight published in Telangana Today, the Medak MP visited her home at Konaipally in Doulthabad Mandal on Sunday presented Rs 50,000 to Sravanthi.

Sravanthi can now pay the fee on Monday when counselling of the HORTICET will begin.

Congratulating Sravanthi for scoring the 3rd rank by overcoming all hurdles, Reddy said the Telangana government would always be there to support poor talented students. Inviting Sravanthi’s family to his office in Hyderabad, the MP said that he would take care of all her educational expenses for the next four years.

After coming to know that Sravanthi’s elder sister Kalyani, who discontinued her studies after her Diploma in Agriculture, was looking for a job, Reddy assured to help her too.

The sisters were struggling to find funds to continue their studies due to the family’s weak financial situation. While their father Swamy was rearing sheep to take care of his three daughters, his wife Nagamani was rolling beedis to support the family. Kalyani too was supporting the family by sewing apart from preparing for competitive examinations. Meanwhile, the youngest daughter, in Xth Class now, of Swamy and Nagamani was also performing well in her studies.

Swamy and Sravanthi had thanked the Medak MP for his kind gesture. Meanwhile, some more philanthropists are coning forward to support Sravanthi’s education and other expenses.",['Telangana Today'],2022-12-04 14:03:07+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ranker-1.jpg,[],[],,"['Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"
Several private engineering colleges flout fee norms in Telangana,"Several private engineering colleges flout fee norms in Telangana

In the garb of miscellaneous fee, several private engineering colleges were found to be charging a fee excess than what is prescribed by the government.

By Yuvraj Akula Updated On - 11:35 PM, Thu - 1 December 22

Hyderabad: In the garb of miscellaneous fee, several private engineering colleges were found to be charging a fee excess than what is prescribed by the government. This has come to light with several students knocking on the doors of the Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC).

The State government has a fixed fee to be charged under the special services fee from students under 11 categories including college functions (Rs 75), health centre services (Rs 100), reading room (Rs 25), college magazine (Rs 50), hobby centres (Rs 25), student handbook (Rs 25), lab fee (Rs 150), library fee (Rs 125), computer and internet fee (Rs 250), placement cell (Rs 125) and games and sports (Rs 50).

However, in the guise of the miscellaneous fee category, the colleges were found collecting fees for the reading corner, transportation and hostel fees despite students not availing of such facilities in the colleges.

“During the hearings, the colleges have shown us that they collected the fee under the miscellaneous category. However, there is no such category in the fee collection. Every component under which fee is collected must be mentioned,” an official said.

So far, the committee has served notices on 26 colleges and in fact, levied a penalty of Rs 2 lakh per student on over 20 colleges besides ensuring the excess fee is refunded to students.

The committee had already warned colleges that it would levy a hefty penalty of Rs 2 lakh on management for every complaint from students which on verification is found true.

It also made it clear that penalties would be collected from the funds lying with the Telangana State Engineering, Agriculture and Medical Common Entrance Test (TS EAMCET) convener. Asked whether such penalties would stand in the court, the official said a resolution was passed in the committee meeting on the same.

Panel to scrutinise admissions

Meanwhile, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education has decided to constitute a special committee comprising professors to scrutinise admissions particularly made by the private engineering colleges under the management quota.

The committee was being constituted as the council received several complaints from parents and students stating that merit was not followed by the colleges while admitting students under the management quota seats.

“Each complaint relating to B-category admissions in the private engineering colleges will be scrutinized by the committee. Any deviation will be viewed seriously,” an official said.","['Telangana Today', 'Yuvraj Akula']",2022-12-01 23:30:44+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/private-engineering-college.jpg,[],[],,"['Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"
Telangana Agriculture Minister terms MSP hike “too little”,"June 10, 2022 06:36 am | Updated 06:36 am IST - HYDERABAD

Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to stop shedding crocodile tears on the farming community of Telangana and sought to know why State president of the party Bandi Sanjay had gone into hiding on the issue of Rabi paddy procurement after announcing that he would take the responsibility.

Responding to a letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao by Mr. Sanjay on Thursday, the Minister demanded that Mr. Sanjay rub his nose before the Bhagyalaxmi temple for running away after provoking the farming community on the Rabi paddy issue.

On the issue of investment support to farm sector, he said there is no comparison whatsoever between Rythu Bandhu and PM-Kisan scheme as the Centre is spending ₹580 crore on the scheme for one of the three instalments, while Telangana is giving about ₹7,500 crore per crop season for two seasons a year. Further, the State government is spending another ₹1,500 crore a year on Rythu Bima scheme, he explained and suggested Mr. Sanjay to get the details from his assistants if he is not aware of them.

Besides, the Telangana government is the only State in the country to provide 24×7 free power supply to agricultural pump-sets and is also giving water under projects without collecting any cess. He asked Mr. Sanjay to get schemes like Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, 24×7 free power and free water for irrigation across the country if the party has guts and genuine concern towards the farming community.

Mr. Niranjan Reddy also criticised Mr. Sanjay for patting the Centre for marginal increase announced by it on the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, which has already been termed as “too little” by the farmers’ organisations and “far away” from the Swaminathan Commission recommendation of cost plus 50%.

“The MSP announced by the Centre is remunerative only for sunflower and for all other crops, including paddy, it is much below the cost of cultivation,” the Minister said.

Stating that BJP has the history of working against farmers by bringing three black farm laws only to apologise and withdraw them after 16-month long agitations by farmers, Mr. Niranjan Reddy sought to know why ‘Fasal Bima’ scheme is not being implemented in the Prime Minister’s native State of Gujarat, if the scheme is so useful as is being claimed by Mr. Sanjay.",[],2022-06-10 01:06:00+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/l93unn/article65512335.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/IMG_hy19Niranjan_2_1_2D9R3RVA.jpg,[],[],,"['Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"

Telangana draft policy to monetize agricultural data: Here's what to know,"Monetising certain agricultural data has been proposed under a new Agriculture Data Management Policy released by the Telangana government on July 6th. The policy, which aims to codify norms, processes, guidelines, etc. for handling agricultural data, is open to comments from the public until 6th August.

Apart from a clause to monetise data, the policy also proposes instituting grievance redressal and data management officers for various entities, including government departments, handling agricultural data, a grievance redressal mechanism, and key principles on which data governance frameworks, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), etc. can be built for agricultural data. We have summarised these below.

Why it matters? In the report, the state government says “The Government of Telangana has been giving a high priority to the development of the agriculture sector in the state, given that 5 million farmers depend on it and that the sector contributes to about 15% of the GSDP…The Government is keen to make a further impact on the levels of production, productivity, and profitability of the farmers by promoting digital agriculture and extensive use of technologies including the emerging technologies like AI, ML, IoT, Drones and satellite imagery.”

Agri-tech initiatives, even from the Central government are up-and-coming in India.Telangana’s policy could guide the Central government’s approach in this regard as well, as the latter had said last year that it was working on creating a data policy for agriculture.

Comments can be sent in through this form specified in the policy or sent via email to osd_itc@telangana.gov.in with a copy to consultant-itc@telangana.gov.in. The paper also specifies a format in which such comments should be sent.

Committee set up for governing agricultural data

The policy proposes setting up an interdepartmental committee (IDC) which would lay out purposes under which personal data can be processed, SOPs for managing them, as well as the sharing of such data. Officials from the following departments will be a part of the committee, the policy says however it doesn’t specify any ranks for them:

(a) Irrigation & CAD Department;

(b) Planning Department;

(c) Agriculture and Cooperation Department;

(d) Land Administration;

(e) Agriculture Department;

(f) Telangana State Remote Application Centre; and

(g) Information Technology and Communications Department

Even besides the above, the IDC could invite officials from other departments which deal with agricultural, horticultural, and allied activities the policy says.

The principles Telangana plans to govern agricultural data with

For creating Standard Operating Procedures: As aforementioned the IDC will create SOPs. With regards to the same, the policy outlines certain aspects for which the SOPS will have to create procedures, guidelines, formats, checklists, and templates:

i) Data Management Officer

viii) Data Service Providers.

For creating data governance frameworks: The policy asks that entities which deal with agricultural data form data governance frameworks for themselves. For the same it lays down certain guidelines.

Further, the policy categorises such entities into two groups:

i) Agriculture Information Users (AIU) or ‘persons, business entities, public and private organisation that need and use data in accordance with the policy’

ii) Data Service Providers (DSP) which compile data sets that AIUs can use, such as related to agricultural credit, crop management, pest management, etc. create data governance frameworks for themselves.

The principles for the frameworks are as follows:

Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.

i. Data architecture – Standards, rules and policies shall be defined by the entity to describe how data is collected, stored, integrated, processed and used internally within the entity. A comprehensive data architecture should be laid out that specifies the various functionaries responsible for, and the processes and technology used in data management.

ii. Meta-data management – The concerned entity shall devise a method to capture, manage and publish meta-data information with defined access controls.

iii. Data quality – Standards and procedures should be adopted to maintain the integrity and quality of data, in accordance with standards and best practices.

iv. Auditability – Decisions and processes related to data governance must be auditable, as per prescribed standards.

v. Accountability – Accountability of different teams within an entity must be prescribed in a manner that introduces checks-and-balances between domain and technology teams, and between those who create/collect information, those who manage it, those who use it, and those who introduce standards and compliance requirements.

Purposes for processing personal data: While the policy says that the IDC will outline purposes for which personal data can be processed under it, it outlines some such purposes in its annexure. To elaborate further on this, some of these are as follows:

For agricultural credit:

Assessment of credit worthiness and extension of short, medium, and long-term loans to farmers and the associated processes like recovery.

Extending credit to farmers basing on Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWR)

Remote sensor systems are utilized for checking the farm conditions and small scale controllers are utilized to control and mechanize the ranch forms.Download Free Sample:Market Dynamics:Growing acceptance of farming automation technologies due to the decline in the availability of farm workers.They are hired agricultural laborers involved in the assistance of agricultural production. There could be various reasons for the decline of farm labor such as infeasibility in farming, rise in agricultural wages, people choosing the non-agricultural sector as living over the agricultural sector, and expansion in cities leading to the selling of agricultural. For instance, agricultural laborers as a percentage of the workforce is declining from 81.0% to 48.2% in developing countries and 35.0% to 4.2% in the developed world by 2016, according to the International Labour Organization.Nowadays, in large part due to the tremendous recent improvements in growing technology, the industry is witnessing blossom like no time before.

Telangana’s Rythu Vedikas truly empowering farmers,"Telangana’s Rythu Vedikas are helping the collective might of farmers; delivery of support is streamlined with better outcomes

Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had conceived and inaugurated the first of the 2,601 Rythu Vedikas (Farmers’ Platforms) in the state two years ago in 2020. They are now yielding desired results. The initiative is proving to be a path-breaking role model in the areas of agriculture, while being hailed by many for being a revolutionary step that would change the contours of the farming sector.

Agriculture is a way of life and tradition that has shaped the culture and economic life of the people of Telangana. It continues to be the focal point to all the strategies for planned socio-economic development of Telangana. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of Telangana and its better performance is vital for inclusive growth. For boosting agriculture production, Telangana Government deployed one Agriculture Extension Officer (AEO) for every 5,000 acres (Cluster) and then felt the need to create a platform for the farmers to assemble, share their ideas and experiences, while also assimilating knowledge on latest technologies.

Accordingly, the Government of Telangana decided to construct 2,601 Rythu Vedikas (2,462 in rural areas and 139 in urban parts of the state) in all the Agriculture Extension Officer’s clusters. Government earmarked an amount of Rs 22 Lakhs for each Rythu Vedika towards the construction cost. Rythu Vedikas are the first of its kind in India where a platform is created for the farmers to organize themselves in groups for attaining their ultimate objectives to get the remunerative prices for their crops, better marketing facilities, higher productivity and ultimately making the agriculture profitable. They will also help the farmers to organize themselves into a formidable group to protect their rights. As on date construction of all the Rythu Vedikas has been completed.

The Rythu Vedikas are provided with tap water, electricity, furniture, while the state government also bears the maintenance costs. The Government of Telangana proposes to connect all Rythu Vedikas across the state through the optical fiber network of T-Fiber by ITE&C department. The AEOs are working from the Rythu Vedikas and are utilizing the Rythu Vedikas as AEOs office. Rythu Bandhu Samithi members are also working from Rythu Vedikas. Rythu Vedikas function through three verticals manned by qualified staff. They are -- Delivery of Services, Capacity Building and Knowledge Dissemination. They also get farmer advisories, besides linkages with service centers for all the Government schemes.

Delivery of services include: Crop Booking, Enrolment of farmers under Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bhima, PM Kisan, etc., and implementation of various state and centrally sponsored schemes by selection of farmers. Capacity building includes region specific and crop oriented training programs to create awareness among the farmers. Also, training of the farmers on identification, advantages of natural risks and timely application of inputs to harness the higher yields are provided. The emphasis is to empower the farmers by adopting good agricultural practices, duly emphasizing the critical stages of a crop and decision making in his own field, and also helping to minimise the pesticide and insecticide usage. As part of knowledge dissemination, training and field diagnostic visits and demonstrations take place.

Besides, timely farm advisories to farmers on pests and disease outbreak, weather updates, market prices, availability of seeds, fertilizers, etc., at Rythu Vedikas in Coordination with Agriculture University, IMD, TSDPS, etc., are provided to the farmers. Rythu Vedikas are serving as service centers for all Government schemes at cluster level by disseminating the latest guidelines, feedback of farmers and for making the schemes more reachable to the farmers thereby achieving the ultimate objective of making Rythe Raju (Farmer the King).

Agriculture and Horticulture Universities, National level institutes like WALAMTARI, DRR, DOR as well as State and National Institutes on Agriculture and allied departments are utilizing the Rythu Vedikas for their programs.

The formal inauguration of the initiative was accompanied with passion, courage, vision, determination and devotion of CM KCR to usher in a qualitative, quantitative and expressive farm policy that would eradicate all problems, adversaries and ill effects of the farm sector and make it a profitable sector forever. More than the stated aims and objectives, the Rythu Vedikas ably supported by the government policies would become instrumental to bring in a transparent, people-friendly and progressive change in the governments to come.

Chief Minister Rao has unveiled his vision for the Rythu Vedikas’ role in Telangana by asserting that they should become a formidable force not only in agriculture but also focal centers to determine change in governance. He also wanted farmers to utilize the Rythu Vedikas to stall attempts by the Centre to thrust upon the anti-farmer and pro-corporate Farm Acts that were brought in forcibly and later withdrawn by the union government.

Inaugurating Rythu Vedika, the Chief Minister made a passionate plea to farmers to utilize the Rythu Vedika and the opportunity provided by the government to become a united force and charter the course of their profession in the way it is profitable and comfortable. He envisaged that through Rythu Vedikas, farmers at a later stage would be able to determine which crops they should cultivate, what price they should fix for their produce and how to market them for greater profitability.

Referring to the concept of Rythu Vedika, CM KCR said that nowhere in the world or in the country, farmers were organized and this Telangana Model is the first of its kind step to make farmers united and a formidable force since the farmers by and large in our country and worldwide were left to themselves.

He compared the situation of agriculture before and after the formation of the state. Apart from an increase in the extent of cultivation by leaps and bounds, the output also reached dizzy heights. He also said that no other state in the country, not even the Centre, is implementing a slew of programs, projects, policies and schemes for the agriculture sector and farmers as was being done in the State. In fact, the pro-farmer and pro-agriculture schemes like Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bhima, Rythu Vedikas, and 24-hour free power supply and host of other schemes were initiated by KCR government without any one asking for it or making a demand for them.

KCR’s vision and dream was to see that one day the Rythu Vedikas should become catalysts for a better change. The Chief Minister made it abundantly clear that he wanted every farmer in the state with the extraordinary support provided by the government to rise to the occasion, and reach a stage where he should be able to clear all his dues and have about Rs 2 to 3 lakh with him as savings to invest into his cultivation on his own without taking any external financial support. “It is then that the real Bangaru Telangana is achieved,” the CM remarked.

No doubt, the Rythu Vedikas in the days to come will become a hub for all the farmer related activities, Agriculture Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination Centers at cluster level duly serving the objective of the Government to provide services at doorsteps of the farmers to make farming sustainable and profitable. Why aren't these replicated all over the country to benefit farmers?

Bengaluru IISc to create Agricultural Data Exchange for farmer services in Telangana,"The Telangana government and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)-Bengaluru have signed an agreement to create India’s first Agricultural Data Exchange (ADEx) to make public and private sector data available for companies to create new farmer services, it was announced Monday.

Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary (IT) of Telangana, said, “Data is the key to enabling new services for our farmers and improving the agriculture sector. With ADEx, we hope to enable a new ecosystem of application developers who will now have access to a best-of-breed data platform to create applications targeted at bringing technology-driven change to the sector. We are thrilled to collaborate with IISc in this endeavor.”

The IISc said the partnership would enable a variety of new services for the farmers ranging from more credit options, better insurance products, improved seed tracking and more targeted farming advisories. “ADEx will be piloted in Telangana with a select set of partners by early 2023, followed by a production rollout within the same state during that year. Both public and private sector data shall be made available through ADEx and a variety of startups and more established companies will be encouraged to build these new farmer services. It is expected that the ADEx will then be made available to other states and broadly deployed across the nation,” it said in a statement.

ADEx will be built on the lines of India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX), which was created within IISc in partnership with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in 2021. “The IUDX is an open-source platform that enables higher operational efficiency in city administration by facilitating data exchange between various civic bodies, municipal departments, application developers, and relevant data consumers,” the IISc statement read.

G Rangarajan, director of the IISc, said, “A nation where the majority of people make their livelihood from agriculture needs to apply its considerable technical firepower to this sector. With the ADEx initiative, the IISc is pleased to be a part of that effort and we have high hopes that this will help the farmers of Telangana and eventually the nation.”","['Var Template_Content', 'Sso_Login_Box', 'Xwelcome Backorenter The Email Address Or Mobile Number Associated With Your Account To Sign In.

Hyderabad: The State government has released the draft of the Agriculture Data Management Policy (ADMP)-2022, which aims to ensure efficient management of agricultural data for development of agriculture sector besides protecting farmers’ rights.

Emerging Technologies in association with World Economic Forum released the draft of the comprehensive policy, and sought suggestions and opinions from various stake-holders before August 6 in a prescribed format.

The State government, with the objective of giving a thrust to the agriculture sector, is developing irrigation infrastructure and providing input subsidy to farmers. In addition to these measures, the State government intends to promote digital agriculture through extensive use of technologies like AI, Machine Learning, drones, satellite imagery to increase production and profitability of farmers.

The idea is to deploy new technologies to transform all the segments of the agricultural value chain. In this regard, data management, including aspects pertaining to agriculture operations, production and general services, is critical resource for successful deployment of new technologies.

Towards this initiative, creating a policy conducive to the systematic collection, processing, sharing and use of agricultural data to support a wide range of use cases in the farm sector was required, with prime focus on protecting farmers’ rights.

At present, there is no such policy. There a possibility of public and private organisations creating data in silos and could be reluctant in sharing the same with other entities. Considering these factors, the government felt it expedient to streamline and codify the processes, responsibilities, norms, and practices relating to the management of agricultural data for farmers and other stake-holders benefit.",['Telangana Today'],2022-07-07 19:38:16+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emerging-Technologies.jpg,[],[],,"['Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Nagarkurnool', 'Nirmal', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak', 'Kamareddy', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Adilabad']"

Hyderabad: Telangana secured the top position among all States by registering double growth in Agriculture in a period of five years. As a result, the Net State Value Added (NSVA) by economic activity from agriculture witnessed a cent per cent rise during 2017-2021.

According to the latest RBI report “Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy 2020-2021”, the NSVA by economic activity from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing increased from Rs 95,098 crore in 2017-2018 to a whopping Rs 1.81 lakh crore in 2020-2021.

Paddy production increased from 62 lakh tonnes in 2017 to 1.23 crore tonnes in 2021. Total food grain production (including pulses) was 1.5 crore tonnes in 2021 as against 94 lakh tonnes in 2017, the report said. During this period, States like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, considered to be fastest growing states in the agriculture sector, registered only 30 per cent to 40 per cent growth in farm production.

Telangana’s tremendous growth can be attributed to the schemes such as Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, free and uninterrupted power supply and irrigation projects among others taken up by the State government with focus on developing agriculture and allied sectors. BJP-ruled States like Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and others, touted to be witnessing double engine growth, had recorded a growth of 10-50 per cent growth.

In mining and quarrying, Telangana’s production grew from Rs 19,885 lakh crore to Rs 25,866 crore. The manufacturing sector witnessed an unprecedented growth from Rs 71,274 crore to Rs 1.03 lakh crore. The State also witnessed growth in trade, repair, hotels and restaurants from Rs 1 lakh crore in 2017-18 to Rs 1.69 lakh crore in 2020-21. The total NSVA increased from Rs 6.09 lakh crore in 2017-18 to Rs 9.38 lakh crore in 2020-21.

Telangana agriculture minister dares Centre to declare amendments to employment guarantee scheme,"By Express News Service

HYDERABAD: Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy has dared BJP national leaders, expected to attend the party's national executive meetings on July 2 and 3, to declare that they would make amendments to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). Reddy demanded the BJP leaders ensure its linkage with agriculture as promised in their 2019 election manifesto.

Addressing media at ministers' quarters on Wednesday, he further demanded the BJP to give constitutional protection for minimum support price (MSP) and declare that procurement will be done as per the legislation.

Instead of making excuses over the alleged unfeasibility of implementing the MS Swaminathan Commission's report, he dared the BJP to determine the MSP based on the (C2+50) principle recommended by the Commission.

He also demanded that BJP implement Rythu Bandhu (Farmers' Investment Support Scheme) across the country and to declare that the power reading meters will not be fitted in agricultural fields, and to assure free power for agriculture across the country.

Detailing out the various arrears from different finance commissions, as per AP Reorganisation Act to backward areas, GST arrears, and others, he has asked the BJP leaders to get the outstanding funds payable by the Centre to Telangana within 3-4 days.

Pointing-out that the budget allocation for agriculture in Telangana was 11.5 to 12 percent, which was far below the national average of 6 to 6.5 percent, and much below the allocation of BJP-ruled states like Gujarat (1.7), UP (4), and Assam (4); he said that Telangana was giving top priority to the agriculture sector.

Hyderabad: With the Telangana government’s increased focus on the agriculture sector through welfare and support oriented schemes for the farming community, farmers in India’s youngest State now own the ‘most expensive’ agricultural lands in the country.

The rising value of agri land, courtesy the farmers reaping benefits of free power supply, schemes to help cultivation like Rythu Bandhu, insurance schemes like Rythu Bima and infrastructural development including roads crisscrossing every district, has seen 16 districts from Telangana placed in the top 34 districts from six States, where the agri land price was ranked ‘most expensive’.

While Medchal was on top of the ‘Most Expensive’ list, the other districts in the top 34 were Jagtial, Rangareddy, Karimnagar, Yadadri Bhongir, Khammam, Medak, Siddipet, Suryapet, Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Nizamabad, Vikarabad, Jangaon, Sangareddy and Warangal.

Meanwhile, Adilabad, Kamareddy, Nagarkurnool and Nirmal were ranked in the ‘Median’ priced category.

The ranking is from the latest Agri Land Price Index launched by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad-based online agri land marketplace, SFarmsIndia. The index, first released in June this year, is based on a hedonic pricing model on a monthly frequency of land listing data and according to IIM-Ahmedabad, could be treated as a ‘quality controlled Agri land price Index for India’.

The index is based on land listing data from the six States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. The data from these six states are aggregated into a national index, according to IIM-A.

The index, it says, could be juxtaposed with other price indices to study the relative movement in land prices with respect to other asset classes. Stakeholders could develop their expectations of how agri land prices have evolved over time, it says.

As for the latest price index, 107 districts from the six States were compared, with 20 districts of Telangana included. In the index, 34 districts in the six States were categorized ‘most expensive’ while land prices in 32 districts are referred to as ‘median’ and land in the rest of the 41 districts were ‘least expensive’.

Hyderabad: Agriculture is not a profession, but a way of life and the governments must take measures to support farmers who are feeding the nation, said Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy. He exuded confidence that India will emerge as the food bowl of the world over the next two decades and wanted youth to take up farming aggressively to feed the world.

Speaking at the 27th annual meeting of Seedsmen Association at Red Hills on Thursday, Niranjan Reddy said the Telangana government took various initiatives to encourage farming and the State has emerged as Rice Bowl of India meeting the food needs of the nation. “Telangana is not only feeding the country, but also nearly 20 other nations by exporting seeds manufactured here. We are making efforts to export seeds to more countries,” he said. There are about seven lakh seed producing farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

On the occasion, the Minister lambasted the Central government over its failure to focus on increasing the seed and agricultural production. He said the Centre lacks a policy on import and export of agricultural products where it was imposing numerous restrictions on exports, but relaxing norms on imports. “We must utilise our potential in seed and agricultural production. Farmers should be encouraged to adopt modern techniques in food production, while scientists should change their orientation to increase the yield. The State government is ready to support them,” he added.

Due to the proactive decisions of the Telangana government, the agriculture and the seed production sectors could survive during the Covid-19 pandemic, said other speakers at the annual meeting of Seedsmen Association.",['Telangana Today'],2022-09-15 22:49:53+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Niranjan-Reddy.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

Hyderabad: Farmers led by the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA) on Tuesday demanded the Centre to implement farmer-friendly initiatives to ensure remunerative returns to farmers. They said though parties like TRS were focusing on farming to increase production, the high-cost inputs and labour due to the lack of Central policy, was making agriculture non-remunerative.

CIFA organised a seminar to prepare an ‘Agriculture-centric agenda for adoption by the non-BJP national alliance’ at Film Nagar Recreation Centre here on Tuesday. The seminar was part of a series of discussions to be held across India involving non-BJP especially the regional political parties, experts and civic organisations, to revise policies and promote sustainable agriculture at national level and become globally competitive.

Addressing the meeting, Janata Dal (United) chief general secretary and former MP KC Tyagi emphasised the need for farmer-centric programmes to achieve sustainable agriculture and make agriculture remunerative for farmers. He said the Centre had failed to address the farmers issues and it was important to ensure that all political parties make their stand clear in their election manifestoes on these issues.

Speakers at the meeting lauded Telangana’s unique agriculture development model initiated by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao that has led to huge production and increased land value making every farmer a millionaire. However, they pointed out that the achievements of Telangana farmers were hampered due to constraints in marketing and exports due to restrictions by the Central government. They demanded that to avoid such situation, the State governments should be empowered for overall development of agriculture especially exports. They strongly felt that Telangana model can be enlarged for adoption.

Meanwhile, the meeting observed that regional parties like TRS, DMK. YSRC and Janata Dal (U) among others have focused on farming and enabled increased production, but the expensive inputs and labour made it unremunerative. Further, the meeting resolved to get political endorsement for upgrading the status of the union Agriculture Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister and also introduce a separate budget.

Other issues on the agenda include reduce production cost; remove GST on fertilisers, pesticides, tractors/farm machinery and drip irrigation system; link MGNREGS with agriculture; empower States to enter into long-term agreements for exports, investments, processing and technologies; and also democratise farm institutions like market yards and commodity boards.",['Telangana Today'],2022-09-27 20:24:23+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cropped-android-chrome-512x512-1-267x267-2.png,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"
Free power to agriculture is bogus: Bandi,"April 15, 2022 06:19 pm | Updated April 16, 2022 07:32 am IST - HYDERABAD

Telangana Rastra Samiti (TRS) Government’s claim of providing round the clock uninterrupted free power supply to the agriculture is a sham as “it is free power in the farm fields and back breaking power bills at home”. With the latest power power tariff hike, upto ₹6,000 crore is being mopped up causing heavy financial burden on the households,” said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Telangana president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Friday.

“The KCR government has been misleading people on free power to agriculture and this bankrupt government is in no position to pay arrears to the power distribution companies to the tune of ₹60,000 crores. The next government will have to bear the brunt of this and it will be one of first things we will do when we come to power,” he said.

On the second day of his ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ in Jogulamba Gadwal’s Lingwai village, the party chief said the government has also increased the RTC fares and because the people are up in arms against these hikes, the Chief Minister took up protests against the Central Government trying to blame it for his “failures” and to “divert” the attention of the people.”

The BJP will agitate against the power tariff hikes till the government takes a back step as it had done with the paddy procurement, he said and appealed for support from the people. The MP said it was unfortunate that the KCR government has been claiming Central schemes as its own schemes like the free rice from the ration shops and others

The district lacked proper irrigation facilities and a health unit despite promises made during the elections. “Every section -- farmers, youth and the poor -- have been suffering under this regime. You should pull up the TRS functionaries when they ask for votes,” he said.

Union Minister for Tourism, Culture and Development of North East G. Kishan Reddy,who walked along with Mr. Sanjay Kumar, said the TS people have turned against the TRS and expressed the confidence the BJP will be voted to power in the next elections.

Compensate Telangana farmers immediately for crop loss: Farm activists,"The Rythu Swarajya Vedika called on both Centre and state, to bury their hatchet and ensure disaster relief to lakhs of affected farmers

The farmers of Telangana have faced unprecedented crop losses in the wake of heavy rains and floods this month. The government should immediately compensate them, an independent farmers’ organisation based in the two Telugu states said July 23, 2022.

Activists of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV) also called out the Telangana government’s policies towards farmers.

They addressed a press conference in Hyderabad where they released a factsheet on the claims made by the state and the Centre. The claims dealt with disaster relief, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

The organisation called on both the Centre and state, who have been engaged in a political slugfest, to bury the hatchet and ensure that disaster relief reaches lakhs of affected farmers.

Telangana has been hit by flooding twice in a fortnight now. The first round of flooding happened around July 15 along the Godavari river. On July 22 and 23, heavy rains inundated low-lying areas in Hyderabad and its neighbouring districts such as Medak, Sangareddy and Mahbubabad.

The Met Department has said Telangana is set to get more rains over the next three days. The state’s north and north-eastern districts are set to receive heavy rains and a red alert has been issued for north Telangana districts, Met Department director K Nagaratna told this reporter.

“Up to 20 centimetres of rain is expected in some places. We have given a flood warning for the state. As of now, we have received 119 per cent rainfall and Nizamabad and Karimnagar districts have received highest rains,” she added.

Flawed policies

The RSV expressed concern over extensive damage to cotton, maize, soyabean and red gram crops due to the heavy rains and overflowing waterbodies.

The activists cited preliminary reports of crop damages over 445,154 hectares across the state. They sought immediate enumeration of crops, livestock and lands affected.

They also criticised the government’s lack of data regarding tenant farmers.

“Details of actual cultivators including tenant farmers should be noted down immediately. The Telangana government has refused to implement the Licensed Cultivators Act 2011 and failed to identify lakhs of tenant farmers,” Kiran Vissa, from the RSV, who is in the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said.

“It would be difficult for the government to zero in on tenant farmers and pay compensation in the future if not done soon. Not doing so now would only lead to the government taking the plea of being too late,” he added.

The activists also took exception to giving a go-by to the standard practice of farmer-wise enumeration of crop loss immediately after a disaster.

They said this had led to a handicap even when funds were available. Compensation was provided in 2018 in Adilabad and Khammam districts purely owing to the initiative of the district collectors as they had data and most of the amount went to those districts, the RSV said.

They also highlighted the issue of crop insurance schemes. Telangana exited the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana from the kharif season of 2020.

However, it had failed to establish its own schemes unlike other states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Its farmers thus had not received any compensation despite heavy losses.

Kanneganti Ravi, RSV activist said taking the Telangana government to the High Court for the State of Telangana twice over the past four years over payment of compensation to farmers had not resulted in changing its attitude. In 2018, it was forced to distribute a meagre Rs 23 crore as input subsidy.

“The state went on appeal to the Supreme Court after it lost the case and failed to pay the Rs 188.23 crore for crop losses approved by the Centre between July and September 2021. This despite the state’s crop damage assessment of Rs 552 crore according to the NDRF scale of relief,” Ravi said.

He added that this exposed the claims of generosity by the Centre to the state. “The state government’s failure to fulfil its promise to waive farmers loans has resulted in denial of fresh loans from banks to farmers,” he added.

Telangana has failed to adhere to norms laid down according to guidelines issued in July 2015 and failed to submit reports of expenditure incurred.

Funds according to norms are released by the NDRF, subject to spending of 50 per cent of funds available with the SDRF.

As the SDRF had Rs 977 crore on March 31, 2020 (according to the state accountant general’s letter) and the approved Rs 245.96 crore was less than 50 per cent of the amount, new funds were not released by the Centre. This laid bare, the claim of lack of central assistance for disasters, the RSV factsheet said.

It further said the state government had made mutually contradictory statements in the apex court. It claimed lack of assistance from the Centre despite submission of damages.

At the same time, it said the entire affected crop was recovered completely in October 2020. It thus deduced no need for compensation payment and added that it was too late to identify the farmers now.

This stand has continued despite pronouncements by the state agriculture minister. He had made them after visiting chilli and fruit farmers in Warangal in the aftermath of a hailstorm in January 2022.

Chief Minister K Chandra Sekhar Rao had also seconded this proposal. But farmers are yet to receive any compensation.

The RSV also pooh-poohed the claims of the Telangana government over non-cooperation by the Centre in disbursal of relief funds. They showed a letter from the accountant general to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as proof.

The letter noted the SDRF had a balance of Rs 977 crore on April 1, 2020. It also received Rs 449 crore from the Centre for 2020-21, Rs 149.67 crore from the state for 2020-21 and Rs 10,005 crore diverted from the Telangana Building and Other Workers Welfare Board, which is said to be against established norms.

The RSV said the state should immediately submit its pending accounts for earlier expenditure from SDRF and their current status. If the funds have been spent on Covid pandemic relief, the same should be made public. They also called on the Centre to immediately release full assistance for disaster relief.

Absence of such relief would only add to the growing number of farmer suicides, especially of tenant farmers, B Kondal Reddy, convenor of RSV, said.",[],None,https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-07-23/0.61926800_1658588730_telangana.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Gadwal', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"
How Telangana Can End Its Overreliance on Paddy and Cotton Crops,"On my recent visits to Telangana, I observed that cropping patterns are highly skewed towards only two crops – paddy and cotton. This overdependence on two crops leads to increased exposure to production and price risks, complete devastation due to pests and disease outbreaks, and environmental perils.

The net sown area in Telangana is about 135.63 lakh acres and the gross cropped area was 203 lakh acres. Net irrigated area in the state is about 55 lakh acres with 78.1 lakh acres gross irrigated area. Of the 59.48 lakh farmers in the state, 65% have small landholdings of less than 1 hectare (1 hectare = 2.47 acre).

The major crops during the rainy season are cotton (45% of the sown area) and paddy (39%), with a small share under cultivation for red gram, maize and soybean. During the post-rainy season, a majority of the cultivated area is occupied by paddy (77%), with some areas growing maize (7%), Bengal gram (5%) and groundnut (4%).

Telangana is the largest producer of paddy and the second-largest producer of cotton in India. Crop production accounts for about 43% of the state’s agricultural GDP, with the remainder being contributed by livestock, dairy and poultry and so on.

The monocropping of paddy and cotton in the state is leading to problems in procurement as well as excessive exposure to price and yield risk and sudden potential outbreaks of pests and diseases. This happened last year, when the chilli crop failed in some parts of Telangana. With the complete loss of the crop, farmers lost from Rs 1.3-1.5 lakh per acre.

Sustainable agricultural growth in the state requires not only crop diversification but also diversification towards livestock, dairy, meat and fisheries sectors as demand for the latter is increasing steeply. This diversification strategy makes farmers’ incomes more resilient to fluctuating prices and climatic aberrations and can help them realise higher farm incomes.

Also read: Why Governments Need to Advise Farmers on Alternative Cropping Patterns

Over the years, the government of Telangana has been encouraging farmers to diversify crops to increase farm incomes and mitigate risks, with little progress.

Although the yield of paddy is reasonably good with 22-25 quintal per acre, cotton yields are low at 2.8 quintals per acre in the state, but cotton has benefitted from higher market prices in some years. In the rainy season, crops like soybean, maize and red gram are emerging as alternative crops, while in the rabi season, maize, Bengal gram and groundnut are alternative crops.

The government is also promoting palm oil, fruits and vegetable crops in a big way under irrigated conditions. For the last two or three years, the state government has been trying to diversify the area under cultivation for paddy to include alternate crops, such as pulses and oilseeds, with little success. It is time to take up crop diversification on mission mode to avoid procurement problems as well as the other risks mentioned above.

Under the one district-one product approach, crop colonies are promoted to encourage farmers to switch to high-value crops by identifying and providing necessary basic commodity-specific infrastructure, such as processing units and post-harvest infrastructure around a particular commodity in each district. The department of agriculture is also propagating alternate crops through demonstrations, farm mechanisation and value addition, and other site-specific activities.

There are multiple schemes running in Telangana aimed at crop diversification to promote the production of palm oil, horticulture, bamboo and agro-forestry. Cash-and-kind incentives to cultivate alternate crops like palm oil also exist, but with little success.

In many parts of the state, even under borewells, paddy is being grown in two seasons due to policies like 24/7 free electricity. This is not sustainable in the long run and will prove too costly for both the government and the farmers.

Paddy is a water-guzzling crop, consuming about three to five times (3,000 to 5,000 litres per kg grain) more water compared to pulses and oilseeds (about 900 litres per kg grain). Long-run stable policies for promoting crop diversification are the need of the hour. The past policies for the promotion of pulses, oilseeds and other alternate crops are not stable enough to trigger a shift from paddy.

Although alternate crops fetch higher prices in a few years, they are riskier both in terms of yields and prices. In addition, higher market prices of these alternative crops were not able to compensate for low yields. Hence, to promote alternate crops in the state, the government has to implement some sort of price guarantee through the effective implementation of procurement at a minimum support price (MSP), Moreover, the government must make efforts to promote the adoption of yield-enhancing technologies.

Without guaranteed procurement at MSP, the prices of pulses and oilseeds follow the ‘cobweb cycle’, wherein farmers take production decisions based not on forecasted prices during the harvest period, but on the previous year’s prices, resulting in wide fluctuations in prices.

In this scenario, alternative gluts and shortages may occur. To avoid this, the dissemination of accurate price forecasts for the forthcoming harvest period before sowing is important, so farmers can make acreage decisions based on forecasted prices rather than the previous year’s price. One way to do this is by announcing an MSP which will be backed by enough procurement so that the farmers trust the MSP as a price signal for the forthcoming harvest period and plan their acreage accordingly rather than falling into the cobweb cycle.

In addition to the stable price policy, the government has to focus on the development and diffusion of technologies to increase the yields of alternate crops. Groundwater irrigation plays an important role in the diversification out of paddy, as it facilitates controlled water release, which is a prerequisite for growing crops like vegetables, fruits, chillies and cotton. Due to this reason, districts more dependent on groundwater (like borewell irrigation) should be given high priority in crop diversification plans.

Another priority intervention is managing canal irrigation systems to facilitate the controlled release of water as per the crop needs. This controlled release of water will allow farmers to choose crops based on their profitability.

It is worth noting that in high rainfall areas such as Adilabad in Telangana and coastal Andhra Pradesh, there is greater scope for not only increasing crop diversity but also cropping intensity by promoting water harvesting structures (like village ponds or farm ponds) to provide supplemental irrigation, which will increase the scope for the cultivation of vegetables, pulses and oilseeds after the harvest of paddy.

In addition to controlled irrigation, studies by the NITI Aayog have indicated that better market infrastructure, like rural roads, village storage infrastructure and well-connected markets, helped in crop diversification towards high-value crops, such as horticultural crops (fruits and vegetables), which needs to be promoted.

Overall, for the crop diversification plan to be successful, priority has to be given to (i) implementation of MSP for alternative crops; (ii) development and diffusion of yield-enhancing technologies for alternative crops; (iii) expansion of area under controlled irrigation; and (iv) rural infrastructure, including roads and markets.

Yadadri power project works in full swing,"Yadadri power project works in full swing

The project, likely to be commissioned in September next year, is one of the most ambitious steps initiated by CM KCR soon after the formation of the State

By Telangana Today Updated On - 12:12 AM, Mon - 28 November 22

Hyderabad: Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao’s visit to the Yadadri Ultra Mega Power Plant (UMPP) on Monday will not be a regular inspection visit, but one to check on the progress of a major landmark in the making for the State’s power sector.

The project, likely to be commissioned in September next year, is one of the most ambitious steps initiated by Chandrashekhar Rao soon after the formation of the State and will have a major role to play in the continuation of the 24×7 free power supply scheme.

The 4,000-megawatt (MW) power station — billed as the biggest thermal plant in the public sector so far — is coming up in Damarcherla mandal of Nalgonda at an estimated cost of Rs 29,992 crore. Officials expect that once the project was commissioned, Telangana would no longer have any power deficit. Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) has bagged the contract for the construction of the supercritical plant, which will have five units of 800 MW each.

Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS Genco) officials said the first unit would start generating power in September 2023. The second unit was expected to be commissioned in December of the same year, while the remaining two would be commissioned in 2024.

According to Genco officials, the project works are in full swing. About 62 per cent of the work has already been completed. This is the third thermal power plant taken up after the formation of Telangana. Genco established the Kothagudem thermal plant with 800-MW capacity in a record 46 months. The project was commissioned in 2019. Subsequently, the 1,080-MW Bhadradri plant came up near Bayyaram in Bhadradri Kothagudem district.

The project was necessitated after the Narendra Modi government failed to honour the promises made by the then UPA government under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, most importantly those with regard to ensuring adequate power supply to the new State of Telangana. Power was one of the two major challenges that Telangana faced soon after its formation.

While one challenge pertained to sharing Hyderabad as the State capital, the other was to ensure adequate power supply considering the factors such as the massive number of motor pumps for agriculture and the presence of a large number of industrial units. To address these challenges, K Chandrashekhar Rao, then the Chief Minister-designate took up the power supply issue with the UPA government which agreed to construct a new 4,000-MW thermal power plant by NTPC at Ramagundam, allocate the 400-MW Sileru Hydel Power Plant to Telangana and provide major share (53.89 per cent) in the total power generation in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh to Telangana.

But soon after the NDA government came to power, Prime Minister Narendra Modi merged seven mandals along with Sileru Hydel Power Plant to Andhra Pradesh. Irked over this, Chandrashekhar Rao gave a bandh call and termed the Prime Minister a fascist. The NTPC also stated that it would take up the thermal power plant in two phases at Ramagundam due to financial issues.

To ensure that Telangana would not have to depend on others for power supply in future, the Chief Minister took various initiatives, including the completion of pending thermal and hydel power plants, construction of new major power plants and improved transmission and supply network. Proposals were approved to develop the power plants to generate a total of 15,560 MW power, including the Yadadri Ultra Mega Power Plant (4,000 MW) at Damarcherla, Kothagudem Thermal Power Station (800 MW), Kakatiya Thermal Power Plant (600 MW), Singareni Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW where 600 MW unit was already completed), Bhadradri Thermal Power Plant (1,080 MW), Pulichintala Hydel Power Plant (120 MW) and Lower Jurala Hydel Power Plant (240 MW), among others. It was proposed to generate another 5,000 MW through solar power and is being developed.

All these projects were taken up by the State government with its own funds. Despite the Centre delaying necessary environmental clearances and also approvals to obtain loans from financial institutions, the State government managed to complete a majority of these projects.

Accordingly, Damarcherla in Nalgonda district will be developed into a major hub for power generation to meet the increasing electricity needs of Telangana in future. Apart from the 4,000-MW Yadadri UMPP, the project has provision for expansion by another 4,000 MW. Further, there is adequate infrastructure to develop a massive solar power project with an installed capacity of 5,000-6,000 MW in the vicinity.

The power plant is being developed at a strategic location adjacent to the railway stations to ensure a seamless supply of coal from both the Singareni Collieries Company Limited as well as imported coal from Kakinada and Krishnapatnam ports.

Meanwhile, the State government established connectivity with the power grid through three different routes on Warda-Dichpally, Warangal-Varora and Angul-Palasa. Further, around Rs 12,000 crore was spent to develop infrastructure and streamline the disproportionate transmission system. Power purchase agreements were made with several States like Rajasthan such that both States could draw surplus power from each other depending on their needs, taking advantage of the delays in agricultural operations and consumption.",['Telangana Today'],2022-11-28 00:03:15+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Power-plant.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"
"₹3,075 cr. allotted to Telangana under AIF, only ₹360 cr. disbursed","July 10, 2022 11:55 pm | Updated 11:56 pm IST - HYDERABAD

In a move to improve farm related activities in States, the Union government has made an allocation of about ₹1 lakh crore as Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) in the Budget presented in this financial year. In this, a sum of ₹3,075 crore was allotted tentatively for Telangana on the basis of the share of the State in agriculture production.

As per the set cumulative target of ₹1,230 crore by the end of 2022- 23, so far a total of ₹ 511.30 crore was sanctioned under AIF for 447 projects, and disbursed ₹360 crore for 352 projects. ₹718.70 crore will be disbursed by the end of 2022-23 and an action plan was prepared and sent to all District Collectors for implementing projects through district-level monitoring committees.

The AIF is aimed at funding agriculture infrastructure facilities at farm-gate, aggregation points such as Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS), Farmer Producers’ Organisations (FPO) and start-ups.

Under the IAF, farmer entrepreneurs can avail a loan facility to the tune of ₹2 crore and loan repayment period is seven years, including moratorium period of two years.

The eligible activities include post-harvest management projects like storage infrastructure, assaying units, pack house, ripening chamber, cleaning, drying, sorting and grading units, supply chain with e-marketing facility, smart and precision agriculture, input production, farm/harvest automation, purchase of drones, sensors, black chain and artificial intelligence in agriculture.

Individual farmers, farmer groups, agriculture entrepreneurs, large businesses and State agencies can avail the fund.

“For the reasons best known to the officials concerned, we are able to avail only 10% of the fund allocated to Telangana tentatively so far. The Centre is ready to provide another ₹1,000 crore if necessary. But the question is can we be in a position to use the already allocated amount?” asked an official on condition of anonymity.",[],2022-07-10 18:25:50+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

Hyderabad: Fisheries, dairy and other sectors allied to agriculture have achieved significant progress in Telangana since its formation in 2014, the State government said on Monday.

Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who often stresses on the importance of agriculture, had allocated thousands of crores of rupees in the budget during the last eight years for the development of livestock, an official release said.

The livestock wealth was worth Rs 24,878 crore in 2013 and it rose to Rs 94,400 crore by 2021-22, it said.

In sheep-rearing, the number of sheep increased from 1.28 crore in 2012 to 1.91 crore in 2019.

Milk production grew from 42.07 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 to 60.99 lakh tonnes in 2021-22.

Stating that Swarna Bharat Trust was organising numerous services in the region, he said many corporate schools located in apartments were lacked even playgrounds. He said diabetes, hypertension and other severe diseases were affecting youngsters due to the lack of physical exercise. He said even highly paid software engineers and others were prone to serious ailments as they are focusing on packages rather than fitness.

Agriculture varsities’ meet bats for changes in farm education,"June 10, 2022 11:28 pm | Updated 11:28 pm IST - HYDERABAD

The two-day national symposium on “Creating Enabling Ecosystem in Agricultural Universities for Agritech innovations: Challenges and Opportunities” concluded here on Friday, with a call for changes in agricultural education within the purview of the new national education policy.

The meeting organised jointly by the Indian Agricultural Universities’ Association (IAUA) and Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) held four technical sessions in which 40 agricultural scientists form the university and the industry participated.

The concluding session included president of IAUA R.K. Mittal, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology (Meerut, UP), VC of Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University (Gujarat) R.M. Chauhan, and VC of PJTSAU V. Praveen Rao.

They stressed the need for change in the functioning of agricultural universities so that they could efficiently guide farmers to take agriculture sector forward on the lines of countries such as South Korea and Taiwan having minimum natural resources.

They wanted the focus to be shifted to sustainable development of agriculture in the backdrop of climate changes, degrading soil nutrition and lack of nutritional food by taking the new and emerging technologies to small and marginal farmers.

Mr. Chauhan said that the outcome of deliberations at the two-day symposium would be submitted in the form of a report to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Union Government.

On the first day on Thursday, Agriculture Production Commissioner of Telangana M. Raghunandan Rao said that agriculture universities in the country shall put in efforts to make available the emerging technologies to small and marginal farmers so that not only the quality of the produce is improved but the quantity and yield too.

He explained several new initiatives of the Telangana Government in agriculture sector such as Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, free uninterrupted power supply to agricultural pump-sets, revival of minor irrigation tanks, completion of irrigation projects, appointing one agriculture extension officer for 5,000 acres land in cultivation, construction of Rythu Vedikas, among others.

Group Head (Agri & IT Business) of ITC Ltd S. Siva Kumar suggested the varsities to improve productivity, production and quality to ensure good price to farmers by making them available new technologies. He suggested the production to be in the line of consumer demand and food security keeping in mind the shrinking resources and climate change.",[],2022-06-10 17:58:59+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

Opinion: Agriculture can enable regional unity,"Opinion: Agriculture can enable regional unity

Regional parties that are in power in different States need to work on building their own distinctive model of governance by putting forth the work that was done in States such as Telangana.

By Telangana Today Published Date - 12:45 AM, Tue - 13 September 22

By Prof Devi Prasad Juvvadi

The failure of both the UPA and the NDA to fulfil the aspirations of the people and sectors across the country, including agriculture, has created space for the regional parties to emerge with new hope and dimension in the process of development as they focus on local issues and challenges.

Also Read Opinion: Time for EU enlargement

The political fragmentation and the rise of regional political parties has been one of the most important trends in India’s electoral politics in the last few decades. The regional parties that were marginal players on the national scene helped form national governments in 2004 and 2009.

Common Problem

Regionalism is no longer viewed as a negation of nationalism or nation-building. Leaders of the regional parties have started playing an active, and even deterministic, role in the organisation of the Central government. Again, momentum is picking up to unite regional parties and their combined strength may force national parties to forge alliances with them. Recent meetings between regional party leaders have been focusing on leadership. While leadership is important, it is policies, programmes, institutions and people’s participation that is critical to attracting and bringing people together.

What is required is not mere fronts and alliances but a renewed commitment to common problems. Only common issues can bring regional parties onto a platform and one such is agriculture, because government policies, both under UPA and NDA regimes, not only neglected agriculture with a lack of will to stand with farmers but also played an active role in deepening the crisis. The farmer has reached the brink of despair, and what they are experiencing is something which is beyond an agrarian crisis. Agrarian and rural dissent can be politically challenging and elections in five States in 2018 reminded parties of how dissatisfied farmers could derail all electoral calculations.

India continues to be a predominantly agriculture-based economy with over 60% of the population still dependent on the sector. Thus, the community’s disenchantment with any party can be a serious cause for concern. Over 300 seats of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha are from rural areas. The link between agriculture and elections was visible in some States and the agricultural crisis was touted as one of the main reasons for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s loss in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Regional parties opposing the BJP can use this opportunity to reinvent themselves, incorporating the lessons learned from healthy regional parties, such as the need to build durable, agile organisational structures.

Reforms Must

Indian farming desperately needs reforms. Agriculture in the country is confronted with high price volatility, climate risks and indebtedness. As 86% of the farmers are small and marginal with declining and fragmenting landholdings, these uncertainties make them even more vulnerable and risk-prone. A long-term solution to agrarian distress lies in improving farm productivity through a series of measures like mass irrigation programmes through the interlinking of rivers, diversification of agriculture and smart farming. In short term, a farm-centric economy and farmer-centric interventions should be the focus of regional parties to achieve global standards in productivity.

The three farm laws introduced last year appeared to be radical but without any support for the farmer during the transition period. They were also without building consensus with the States and were rammed and withdrawn without alternative steps. For farmers, there is no clarity on how the existing system will be improved, if and how the agricultural policy will evolve and whether we can expect a positive change under this government.

India’s diversity should prompt the regional parties to adopt a federal approach to agriculture and allow State governments to decide the course of action in their regions. It requires bringing the farmers of the country into consensus and discussing federal solutions for agriculture.

The Congress leadership despite having the resources, manpower and considerable vote base has failed to be an alternative to the BJP and its future seems bleak beyond doubt. It is proven that a weak Congress and disunited regional parties keep the BJP in power. The regional parties have brilliant thinkers, smart managers, crafty communicators, leaders with a solid mass base, and moneybags such as K Chandrashekhar Rao, Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar. But these are individual leaders and political entrepreneurs. However, there is no person or process to gather it all together and turn it into a collective strength that could be deployed to save the republic.

Convincing Farmers

Since 2024 will be, by far, the most crucial election, beginning early to get all these factors right is indispensable for the regional parties. These parties can easily convince the farming communities and thus, retain a stronghold over these States for the upcoming elections. The regional parties that are in power in different States need to work on building their own distinctive model of governance by putting forth the work that was done in States like Telangana.

The unity of the farmers that is essential for leaders of regional parties cannot be achieved automatically but with long-term relationship building, historically shared struggles, and concrete work to identify shared and common agendas in farming. This requires building broader movements and continuing cooperation between the farmer organisations.

Chandrashekhar Rao has the experience and track record to fundamentally change the agricultural model of India and catapult it into economic prosperity if the political climate at the national level enables this positive change. Under the circumstances, Rao highlighting farming issues to unify regional parties and exposing national parties which protect their power and privilege in the garb of democracy, secularism, and social justice, is a welcome step in a vibrant democracy.",['Telangana Today'],2022-09-13 00:45:13+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Agriculture.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

Telangana State team visits Rajkot farm machine unit,"July 28, 2022 09:34 pm | Updated July 29, 2022 12:43 pm IST - HYDERABAD

Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy suggested fabrication of machines useful for small landholdings in the country so that farmers with limited income can afford them, and in the process also overcome shortage of labourers.

As part of the State government plans to promote mechanisation in farming, a delegation led by Mr. Reddy visited a farm machinery making unit in Rajkot, a model agriculture market committee and a groundnut processing unit, both at Gondal, in Gujarat on Thursday.

The delegation comprised Secretary (Agriculture) M. Raghunandan Rao, Managing Director of TS-Agros K. Ramulu and others.

Speaking during their visit to Shaktiman Industries in Rajkot, where several machines used in agriculture are manufactured with indigenous technology, the Minister said there is severe short of farm labourers in Telangana following huge improvement in irrigation facilities with most of the farm workers turning farmers themselves.

Farm hands from 11 States, particularly Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, migrate to Telangana during the farm seasons and get livelihood in agriculture and allied sectors, the Minister said. He stated that the farm machines made overseas were useful only to their conditions where they have large landholdings.

Mr. Reddy said about 80 lakh acres of land had come under cultivation during the last eight years with the increase in irrigation facilities and other pro-farmer measures. The State government is planning farm mechanisation on a large scale in the wake of circumstances leading to diversification of crops. He also invited the management of Shaktiman to set up their unit in Telangana.

During the visit to the groundnut processing unit at Gondal, he said the Telangana government would also encourage such units as the extent of groundnut is increasing in the State.",[],2022-07-28 16:04:28+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/s3u2ms/article65695383.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/Niranjan%20Reddy1.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

Helping ryots endure climate change in Telangana,"Niharika Saila By

Express News Service

HYDERABAD: At a time when climate change is impacting farming across the world, researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), have developed climate-smart agriculture (CSA) investment planning tool which helps in selecting locally-appropriate practices, technologies, climate information services, policies and finance options at the Mandal and district level across Telangana.

According to the report titled ‘Towards climate-smart agricultural policies and investments in Telangana, climate risk assessment was carried out after the State was divided into 350 grids. Indicators such as temperature changes, heat and cold wave events, rainfall variability and changes in the frequency or intensity of consecutive dry and wet days in these regions were analysed.

Speaking to TNIE, the lead author Dr Shalander Kumar, Cluster Leader – Markets, Institutions and Policies, ICRISAT, says, “Climate change has been impacting agricultural production, which has resulted in increased climate risk and loss of livelihoods for the farmers. Mainstreaming CSA and food systems practices will increase productivity and adaptation to climate risk.”

The long-term climate analysis of this study indicated a high to very high climate risk in most of the mandals in Nalgonda, Adilabad, Yadadri Bhongir and Nagarkurnool districts. The other major districts facing high climate risk were Mahbubnagar, Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Rangareddy, Nirmal and Suryapet.

Target oriented data

Crops such as cotton, pigeon pea and maize were commonly cultivated in the mandals with the highest climate risks, indicating the need to promote CSA practices that enhance the resilience of these cropping systems in the short run and to assess alternative farming systems strategies for the long run.

“CSA practices may also reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is also critically important for ensuring sustainable food production and also contribute towards more environment-friendly agri-food systems,” Dr Shalender adds.

Practices that were analysed in the study are the drip irrigation system, broad bed and furrow, ridges and furrow, farm ponds, crop residue incorporation, unpuddled mechanical rice transplanting and climate information services. However, not every technique proved to be effective across conditions and districts

“The findings revealed that drip irrigation and farm pond technologies might be highly profitable and weather-resilient but not equally effective across crops and districts. Farm pond technology was found to be most effective for the cultivation of high-value crops like mango and tomato. At the same time, drip irrigation technology proved to be more effective for cotton and groundnut cultivation under extreme weather conditions. Without such information, the investment allocation for climate-resilient technologies is less likely to reach its full potential,” he explains.

Scaling up

While rising food insecurity caused by climate change has alarmed governments, policymakers and farmers across the world, Dr Shalender believes that this investment planning tool will help the people in power make decisions on crops and prioritise investment based on quantitative analysis that reduces climate risk and benefits, farmers, economically as well.

“This science-based CSA scaling framework and policy tool could easily be replicated in the other States of India, and in other countries facing climate threats,” he adds.

DEPENDENT ON FARMING

Rainfed farming systems, representing 54 per cent of the net sown area in Telangana have become increasingly affected by recurring drought and high climatic variability, adversely affecting the livelihoods of millions of farm families.

About 55 per cent of the State’s population is dependent on farm activity. In 2014-15, the gross state domestic product (GSDP) in the agriculture sector declined by 10.3 per cent, attributed mainly to adverse seasonal conditions

By Ashish Pandey: During a review meeting with state officials, Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) observed that the central policies were dampening the agricultural growth of the country.

“It is unfortunate that the Union government's haphazard policies are discouraging farmers from continuing farming and have also reduced the country’s farming output,” he said.

But, CM KCR made it clear that the state government will keep working towards the consolidation of the agriculture sector in Telangana.

He reiterated that the action plan for farmers' welfare would be strengthened further and that government efforts would be continued.

Recently, after going on a protest against the union government over paddy procurement, the Telangana government decided to purchase the farmers’s paddy by itself after there was no response from the Centre.

In view of the Vaanakalam (Kharif season) beginning in a few months, the CM instructed Agriculture Minister, Niranjan Reddy, to make all necessary arrangements in advance.

He suggested planting cotton, chilli, red gram and watermelon crops and other alternative ones too.

HIGH LEVEL REVIEW

The CM held a high level review on the availability of fertilisers, seeds and the agriculture department's readiness to provide other farm related arrangements with the officials at Pragati Bhavan on Tuesday, April 19.

The officials have been asked to prepare a special action plan on profit-making crops.

He instructed the top officials to depute the district officers, village level officials and agriculture extension officers to go on ground level visits and give suggestions to the farmers on cropping patterns.

The top officials were also asked to prepare a ‘job chart’ of the responsibilities and duties of the agriculture officials.

TELANGANA FARMING SECTOR STATUS

The Chief minister said that the weather conditions in Telangana are conducive to the agriculture sector.

As the Indian Meteorological Department predicted that the state would receive bountiful rains, the CM hoped that the growth in the farm sector would be encouraging this year.

Before the new farm season begins, the CM asked the officials to procure adequate quantities of fertilisers and seeds to ensure that farmers do not face any difficulties.

“Stern action will be taken against the suppliers and manufacturers of spurious seeds,” he warned.

“In the Telangana state, the contribution of the farming sector to the GSDP (Gross Domestic Product) is 21 percent,” he said, noting that the farm sector played a key role in strengthening the state economy.

NO DROUGHT IN TELANGANA

The question of drought in agriculture should not arise in the future and it is imperative that the state agriculture department should be vibrant, fast and always busy, the CM advised officials and the agriculture minister.

KCR instructed the officials to prepare a district action plan to strengthen the farming sector by involving district Collectors and Revenue division officers (RDOs).

‘REDUCE INDISCRIMINATE FERTILISER USE’

The CM also focused on reducing the indiscriminate use of fertilisers. He asked officials to educate the farmers about scientific methods in the use of fertilisers.

The CM expressed concerns about the repeated farming of single crops for years, which resulted in the soil health being spoilt.

“The need of the hour is to adopt alternative cropping to protect soil quality,” said the CM, asking officials to prepare required plans in this direction also.

The CM appealed to farmers to seek expert advice on the use of urea and advised the farmers to use urea in three or four phases instead of one time while growing paddy.

He also stressed the need to use complex fertilisers in a limited quantity and asked the officials to create awareness among farmers about the use of fertilisers in tune with the changing conditions.

TELANGANA COTTON IN HIGH DEMAND

Post the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for cotton grown in Telangana has increased in China and other countries, where the crop output had reduced.

The issue of increasing cotton prices, from one quintal cotton at Rs 10,000 to Rs 13,000, and the increasing demand were also discussed.

The CM told the officials to encourage farmers to adopt cotton cultivation. “The demand for chilli is also high, as it is being sold at Rs 42,000 per quintal in the open market,” the CM said.

"Rains impact cotton farming, push up paddy cultivation","September 03, 2022 06:48 pm | Updated 06:48 pm IST - HYDERABAD

Impacted by heavy rains and floods, the cropping pattern this Kharif season has ducked the plans of Agriculture Department with paddy poised to reach a record extent with rains affecting the cotton cultivation adversely while abundant availability of ground and surface water is encouraging farmers go for paddy extensively.

In its kharif-2022 plan, the Agriculture Department has estimated the extent of cultivation at 142 lakh acres (1.42 crore acres) with cotton in over 70 lakh acres, paddy in up to 50 lakh acres and redgram about 15 lakh acres as major crops. The total extent as on September 1 has crossed 128.21 lakh acres with paddy transplanted in 58.29 lakh acres, cotton in 48.96 lakh acres and redgram in 5.55 lakh acres.

Cultivation of paddy is likely to go up further with the transplantation going up till the month-end. Its extent till September 1 is second only to the record extent achieved last year when the cereal crop was raised in 61.95 lakh acres. It was above 50 lakh acres (53.33 lakh) only one more time in the past – in 2020.

“The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare has asked the farming community to take paddy cultivation on a large scale this year. But due to various reasons, it has come down by 5.6% till the week ending September 2 in the country. However, in Telangana it has gone up by 39% during the same period and is likely to go up further”, an Agriculture Department official said.

Agriculture officials stated that only crops like sunflower, maize, groundnut and few other horticulture crops including chilli and tobacco could be taken up till the month-end with the recommended sowing/transplantation period for all other major crops including cotton is over at the July-end itself. The extent this season so far has crossed that of the last Kharif only this week as it has been lesser all along due to continuous rains.

On the other hand, the extent of cotton stopped short of the 50 lakh acre mark this season as it reached only 48.96 lakh acres. Only in 2020 (60.54 lakh acres) and 2019 (54.46 lakh acres) the fibre crop was cultivated in the extent beyond 50 lakh acres.

Similarly, the government plans to promote redgram cultivation in 15 lakh acres has also fallen flat as it is the lowest (5.55 lakh acres) since formation of the State in 2014. The previous lowest was in 2017 when it was taken up in 6.2 lakh acres and the highest was in 2020 when it was cultivated in 10.85 lakh acres followed by 10.65 lakh acres in 2016.",[],2022-09-03 13:18:10+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"
Telangana to ask Centre to lift entire crop of pulses at MSP- The New Indian Express,"By Express News Service

HYDERABAD: The Agriculture department has decided to to the Centre, requesting it to procure the entire produce of pulses from the State at Minimum Support Price, instead of procuring only 25 per cent of the produce through Markfed as being done every year.

During a review meeting held with higher officials at Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) at Rajendranagar on Tuesday, Agriculture Minister G Niranjan Reddy asked officials to see that paddy varieties that didn’t result in splitting and wastage during milling be encouraged in rabi. Officials were also directed to create awareness among farmers to ensure that harvesting was preponed by 15-30 days, so that they could reap the harvest before March, as delaying it further could risk getting damaged due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms.

Niranjan Reddy also directed officials to ensure that field experimentation of cotton cultivation for the coming rabi season is done in the agricultural university and other demonstration fields of the agricultural department.

It was decided that farmers will be encouraged to go for black gram, chickpea, sunflower, groundnut and oilseeds in rabi. Keeping in mind the requirement of onions and vegetables, officials were asked to prepare plans to encourage their cultivation during rabi.

The Minister asked officials to make use of Rythu Vedikas and conduct meetings with farmers so that they could be informed about the right quantity of seeds to be sown, fertilisers and other inputs. This can bring down the input costs, the Minister opined.In view of the kharif harvest approaching, officials were asked to ensure enough tarpaulin sheets were made available to prevent paddy from getting soaked in the rain during the procurement process.

Red sanders growers in Telangana feel the blues,"October 03, 2022 06:10 am | Updated October 07, 2022 12:10 am IST

The very word Red sanders ( yerra chandanam in Telugu), made more popular by the recent Allu Arjun blockbuster, Pushpa, traces the dubious manner in which smuggling of this precious tree species is carried out by mafia raj.

But away from the gaze of Seshachalam forests in Andhra Pradesh, many farmers in the Telugu States, who have planted Red sanders without any common registry or association, are running from pillar to post to sell their genuinely grown trees, not because of lack of market, but enabling-policy.

Matured two-decade plus old Red sanders (RS) trees grown in private agriculture orchards in some parts of north Telangana are languishing for want of the necessary permits, and the farmers, who have grown these trees, are literally staring at a bleak future.

Red sanders or Pterocarpus Santalinus, as its botanically known, is literally gold: a tree can sell for ₹30 lakh to over ₹1.5 crore, depending on its grade quantity.

The Red sanders is an Indian endemic tree unique to a distinct tract of marginal laterite soils in the Eastern Ghats. The tree matures in about 25 to 40 years. Traditionally, its use in India is limited to herbal medicines, agri-implements and figurines of deities.

Internationally, Red sanders has a high demand, particularly in China and Japan, for making vintage furniture and musical instruments; and in Europe and the US for its rich natural dye to colour food and premium alcohols.

It is illegal to cut, store, transport and sell Red sanders in any form. High demand for Red sanders in the international market is the main cause for unabated smuggling in AP and its border States, because it is not local market, the disgusted farmers succumb to the mafia offers. That too when it gets confiscated, seen as produce from forest, because no farmer dares to claim ownership.

The government has issued policy guidelines for felling of Red sanders grown in private lands and patta lands, which is not an enabling policy.

‘Trying to sell since 2018’

Coming down to the woes of such growers, Nakkala Samson of Dharmaram B village in Nizamabad district, narrates how he is struggling to sell the fully grown trees since 2018.

In 1985, he planted three Red sanders saplings at his home in Dharmaram (B), Nizamabad, and 20 in his in-law’s mango orchard at Chillaboinapalli, in Krishna district, of which eight survived. These 35-year-old trees measure one metre girth at the breast height. Now, they are awaiting permission to fell and sell them.

Similarly, Ganapuram Rajesh, a farmer from Pedda Valgote in Sirikonda mandal of Nizamabad, too planted Red sanders 17 years ago with a hope of earning a fortune.

“For the past two years, I am running around forest offices in vain to get felling permission. I have also paid ₹40,000 fee. Authorities are asking me to show proof of buyer first, buyers are asking me to show permit first,” he remarked.

According to Mr. Samson, without felling and dressing the Red sanders, real merchandise cannot be displayed to attract buyers. The government should bring out a clear policy to enable RS farmers to market their produce.

“The market is full of intermediaries, if not smugglers. I even came across some disgusted farmers who have removed Red sanders for firewood. Most of the mouth drooling Red sander stories are media promoted which works best for the Red sanders nursery growers,” says Samson.

Mudam Limbaiah, a farmer of Reddipet village in Machareddi mandal of Nizamabad district, planted 400 Red sanders spending ₹32,000, 12 years ago. He was assured by the plant supplier that the “trees would reach harvestable age after 15 years, giving huge tonnes of precious species and good returns.” “Even in Seshachalam forests, they don’t mature so fast,” he bemoaned.

Nalla Venkatarama Reddy, a farmer, and also Rythu Bandhu district coordinator from Nirmal, has 26 matured Red sanders on his property, but is unable to begin felling process, let alone selling. “When I approached the Forest Department, they asked me -- who is your buyer, where will you store the merchandise etc -- for which I have no ready answer,” he remarks.

“ Most of the mouth drooling Red sander stories are media promoted which works best for the Red sanders nursery growers.”Nakkala Samson Dharmaram B village, Nizamabad district.

The present jurisdiction of forest authority relating to Red sanders grown in private lands is limited to certificate that it is not sourced from forest and allow farmer to fell and transport it, but they don’t have further mandate of custody and marketing as they did with confiscated Red sanders.

The permit process for private Red sanders begins with taking an entitlement certificate from the tahsildar to approach the concerned Divisional Forest Officer for due verification and permit to fell and transport.

The reluctance of the forest authorities to give a felling permit, stems from the fact that even after the tree is felled, the Forest Department is burdened with unending vigilance over the felled Red sanders till its final disposal by the farmer, all the time vulnerable to departmental politics.

The way forward

The private Red sanders growers opine that the one way forward for the private marketing of Red sanders is for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments to mandate their authorities to act as aggregator-custodian-market facilitator. This would give the farmers an integrated window: the farmer receives a Red sanders entitlement certificate from the Revenue Department, they contend.

The farmer then presents this to the forest authority, who permit felling and dressing at farm gate, and thereafter take custody of the dressed material under proper acknowledgement.

The forest authority sorts and grades the dressed material, geotagged by farmer, and is responsible for its safe custody under 24/7 surveillance with remote access to allow the farmer keep a watch over it for himself/herself, and use this to negotiate working capital from the banks as well as display and negotiate with private buyers, till the conclusion of e-auction-cum-e-bidding.

It was pointed out that somewhat similar practice with variation of e-auction-cum-bidding is in vogue in Tamil Nadu. The TN forest authority is felling, dressing, transporting, and buying sandal wood grown in private and patta lands with inclusive of all costs and commission within 20%.

Similar approach with Red sanders would go a long way and encourage farmers in achieving the national goal of 33% forest/tree cover. “We appeal the State governments of AP and Telangana to convene consultation meetings with Red sanders farmers for a consensual policy with utmost priority,” Mr. Samson pleads.",[],2022-10-03 00:40:00+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/amkz9v/article65963538.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/Redsander5.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

Hyderabad: Farmers should be encouraged to grow agricultural products like millets keeping in view contemporary conditions and food habits of the world, Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy said.

He stated that Telangana was recording a huge increase in crop production in the last eight years and that cultivation was taken up in about 1.45 crore acres for this Vaanakalam (Kharif) season alone.

Addressing a national seminar on millets organised by Indian Institute of Millet Research (IIMR) at HICC on Friday, the Agriculture Minister said the food habits of people were changing across the world and farmers should cultivate crops according to the market demand. He said Telangana was popular for millet production, which however, had declined in recent times. Considering market demand, he emphasised the need to promote millet cultivation again.

“There is a huge market for millet-based food especially processed ready-to-eat products. Scientists and agricultural research organisations must work towards increasing the yield which will encourage farmers to take up millet cultivation,” he said.

He demanded the Centre to announce a Minimum Support Price for millets and also to supply them to ration card holders through fair price shops.

On the occasion, the organisers announced awards for organisations, scientists and officials who were promoting millet cultivation. Kumram Bheem Asifabad additional collector Chahat Bhajpai received an award for the Telangana government in this regard.

Andhra students dominate Telangana EAMCET,"August 12, 2022 02:28 pm | Updated 06:50 pm IST

The results of the Telangana State Engineering, Agriculture and Medical Common Entrance Test (TS EAMCET) 2022 have been released with 80.41% of candidates clearing the test in the engineering stream and 88.34% candidates in the Agriculture and Medical stream.

Minister for Education P. Sabitha Indra Reddy released the results and they are hosted on https://eamcet.tsche.ac.in and a few other websites. She said out of the 1,56,860 who appeared 1,26,140 qualified in the engineering test while out of the 80,575 who appeared in the Agriculture and Medical stream 71,180 emerged successful.

City boy Polu Lakshmisai Lohit Reddy topped the engineering stream and, interestingly, seven out of the top 10 were from Andhra Pradesh. Second rank went to Nakka Saidipthika (Srikakulam) followed by Polishetty Karthikeya (Tenali), Palli Jalajakshi (Srikakulam) and Menda Himavanshi (Srikakulam).

In the Agriculture and medical stream, Juturi Neha from Tenali bagged the first rank followed by Vantaku Rohit (Visakhapatnam), Kallam Tarunkumar Reddy (Guntur), Kothapalli Mahi Anjan (Kukatpally) and Guntupalli Sriram (Guntur).

This year’s rankings were based on the actual marks scored by the students in the entrance exam as the government has done away with the 25% Intermediate marks weightage given while calculating the final rank.

EAMCET-2022 Convener Goverdhan said that the normalisation process was adopted to eliminate the variations in the difficulty levels of various sessions and ensured that no student got advantage or disadvantage due to multiple sessions. The normalisation process brings all the candidates across all sessions on a comparative scale.

Has low paddy acreage caused Centre’s U-turn on Telangana parboiled rice procurement,"Telangana government and the Centre had been at loggerheads over its procurement for almost a year; now Centre has agreed to procure 0.8 million tonnes

The Union government last week agreed to procure parboiled rice from Telangana amid a low acreage under paddy in Kharif 2022.

The Centre will buy 0.8 million tonnes of parboiled rice grown in Rabi season from the mills in the state, said V Mohan Reddy, general secretary, Telangana Rice Millers Association.

Parboiled rice is rice that has been partially boiled in the husk. The state government and the Centre had been at loggerheads over the procurement of parboiled rice for almost a year.

A delegation of parboiled rice mill managements and other associations met Union Minister of Food and Public Distribution, Piyush Goyal in New Delhi recently to discuss the issue.

The decision has also brought some relief to rice mills which were running into losses since last year.

Telangana is a major producer of parboiled rice. The central government refused to purchase more stocks from the state since the last Rabi season (Rabi 2021-22).

Food Corporation of India (FCI) will not be in a position to accept parboiled rice due to its massive stock in the central pool, Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ashwani kr Choubey had said in a written reply to Parliament in February 2022.

Telangana saw an entire week of protests and blockades over the issue in April. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao also brought his government’s protest to the national capital.

Rao, along with his state cabinet, legislators, parliamentarians and other party leaders and workers, sat on a day-long maha dharna at Telangana Bhawan in Delhi.

One of the reasons for the U-turn on the procurement seems to be the worries over a lower acreage under paddy in the ongoing Kharif season compared to last year and anticipation of depletion of government stocks.

There is 13.27 per cent less area under paddy in 2022 compared to last year. Some 23.15 million hectares (mha) of paddy had been sown by July 29, 2022, according to data released by the Union agriculture ministry.

This is 3.55 mha less than what was sown in 2021 during the corresponding period.

Less sown area has been reported from 17 states — West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Assam, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Haryana, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Sikkim.

The government is worried about the possible drop in paddy acreage and its likely impact on the public distribution system.

Goyal urged farmers at a July 5 event to grow more paddy this year, which is a departure from the usual government stance of asking farmers to diversify and move beyond paddy.

There is an additional demand for rice this year since wheat production was alarmingly low, forcing the Centre to substitute it with rice under the National Food Security Act, 2013.

“Less sown area has been reported from many states because of low rainfall and parboiled rice from last Rabi season will help in improving the stocks. We are thankful to the government. This will help the farmers and the mills,” said Mohan Reddy.

The mills have been facing financial constraints since 2021. Around 1,200-1,300 rice mills in the state are in the business of milling parboiled rice and only around 400-500 mill raw rice.

Before stopping the procurement in 2021, FCI used to procure parboiled rice from the state regularly, many times both in Kharif and Rabi seasons, due to which more mills were established in milling parboiled rice and invested in infrastructure and machinery.

But then it suddenly said there was no market and stopped purchasing, said Ravi Kanneganti from Rythu Swarajya Vedika, a network of organisations and individuals working with the farmers.

The FCI procured 2.562 million tonnes (MT) of parboiled rice from Telangana in 2020-21, although the quantity was higher in 2019-20 at 4.471 MT.

This fluctuation in policy is hampering both the farmers and rice millers. “A proper planning will help the farmers and the state government to take better decisions on sowing and the market,” said Ravi.

There are also political reasons for the shift, along with less acreage under paddy, he added.

Asymmetric development reflected in the steep decline in the share of Indian agriculture from 52% of the GDP in 1951 to about 18% in 2022 despite agriculture accounting for about 55% of total employment. This impacts both economic growth and distributive equity.

Holistic Development: How?

Holistically transforming consumption patterns, shifting agricultural practices from sowing to planting, drainage, irrigation, fertilizer, plant protection, harvesting, weeding and storage, diversifying agriculture from foodgrains to high-value items, such as horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and truly sustainable better livelihoods are necessary. Widely acceptable benchmarks developed by Lead Banks and Nabard can be used to assess verifiable quantifiable indicators.

Attention to timeliness, adequacy, security and cost of credit and convergence of BC-based financial inclusion initiatives with the SHG network and macro-level demonstration of banking technologies is needed. Other measures include enhancing productivity of crops and animal husbandry, checking soil erosion and promoting watershed development and a trans-disciplinary approach. Community participation will make groundwater management more effective with wider ownership and deliver longer term regionally sustainable groundwater.

Greater financial inclusion by developing aspirational districts, microfinance, sanction and disbursement of higher credit by banks and financial institutions, formation of Joint Liability Groups and their credit linkage and monitoring and evaluation of verifiable quantifiable indicators and accent on Farmers Producers Organisations will be useful. With record foodgrain production, horticulture diversification, greater significance of allied sectors and changing dynamics of agriculture trade, the key enablers, viz, productivity, mechanisation and irrigation, need strengthening.

The RBI has highlighted agricultural challenges of climate change, agriculture waste management, disguised unemployment and volatile food prices necessitating supply-side interventions like higher public investment, storage infra and food processing industries.

Food Prices

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows a rise in food prices by 75% post-mid-2020. The CPI reveals doubling of rural consumer food prices in FY22 because of the Ukraine war, rising rural costs, which include food production and transport. The food sector is interconnected and interdependent.

The IMF stresses countries should allow hikes in food and fuel prices to pass through to domestic prices since food prices make up 44% of consumption in low-income countries, 28% in emerging market economies and 16% in advanced economies without being oblivious to the needs of vulnerable sections. IMF’s study in Sub-Sahara Africa shows external factors drive food price inflation but domestic factors can reduce their impact through monetary and fiscal policy, overall economic environment and transport constraint.

Transcending Credit

Agricultural credit disbursement rose from Rs 64,000 crore in FY2002 to Rs 17.09 lakh crore in FY22. While credit must grow quantitatively and qualitatively, streamlining credit requires a differentiated needs-based approach, thrust on FPOs to enhance credit and direct credit to desired channels, horticulture and value chain financing. Sweeping changes in cooperatives are reflected in the computerisation of about 63,000 functional Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) with a budget of Rs 2,516 crore (GoI Rs 1,528 crore) to raise the number of PACS to 3 lakh by 2025 and benefit 13 crore farmers.

Agricultural exports rose 20% to $50 billion in FY22 because of production, familiarising State governments and farmers in exports, removing infrastructural, logistics, post-harvest bottlenecks, new markets, greater share in existing markets, reduced transport costs and quality losses, use of refrigerated rail containers and modified tariff structure.

The Centre’s 2018 Agri Export Policy visualised robust agriculture, eg, doubling of exports from $30 billion to $60 billion by 2022, diversified exports, and boosting high value and value-added agricultural exports, non-traditional agri products promotion, greater market access and global integration.

Roadmap

Despite significant State-wide differences because of historical factors, agro-climatic conditions and opportunities for alternative productive employment, stress on KCC/Rupay KCC, crop insurance, land records digitisation and creation of charge, close coordination between the Revenue Department and State Level Banker’s Committee for registration of property rights, stress on balanced/integrated farming and complete knowledge about crops, agro-climatic conditions and market conditions to optimise production and remunerative prices to farmers will help.

Most parts of India have ample sunlight; hence focus on solar power/farms is imperative. There are also aspects such as drip/sprinkler irrigation, hi-tech nursery to promote fruits, vegetables and flowers. Another innovative strategy could be agri-tourism, which is a kind of multi-functionality involving various agricultural activities, animal rides and stay at rural areas with natural and fresh cuisines. Important location-specific criteria include proximate water source, away from polluted environment, better connectivity, natural site, historical importance.

Lack of credit facilities, water resources, specific policy and unclear tax exemption hamper agri-tourism. Given the huge latent potential, focus on site, infrastructure, marketing and displaying agri-tourism products and services is needed. Vocational training and focus on meeting the challenges of first generation women at micro-level business startups will promote women empowerment. Simultaneously, concerted attempts are necessary for greater investment and private participation.

Given the success in semi-arid regions, eg, north Rajasthan, community-based groundwater and ecosystem restoration could check ecological and socioeconomic decline. Locally appropriate, integrated social and technical solutions promote a virtuous cycle enhancing the quality of ecosystems and well-being of the people with effective use of STEEP (social, technological, economic, environmental, political) framework.

The roadmap must bring about a paradigm shift with an emphasis on competitiveness, pricing, quality, diversification, food parks and cold chain infrastructure, value-addition and moving up the value chain. This requires coordinated strategic and operational measures. Strategic action includes policy measures, infrastructure and logistics support, holistic export-oriented approach and greater engagement of State governments. Operationally, undivided attention on cluster-based approach, value-added exports, marketing and promotion of ‘Brand India’, strong quality control and evaluation mechanisms, research and development is needed.

In this vision of ‘a new India’— an India, which is fully developed, inclusive and equitable, agriculture and food exports require synchronised measures by the Centre, State governments, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, National Dairy Development Board, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, exporters, food and agro-processing industry, RBI, Nabard, Exim Bank, banks, agri startups, FPOs/FPCs, apart from farmers themselves.",['Telangana Today'],2022-10-15 00:30:30+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/op-2.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

India’s achievement in the agriculture sector, though impressive in some areas and States, has remained below potential. There is a large gap between the income of agriculture and non-agriculture workers. Even after over seven decades of planning, most farmers still face the problem of poor production and inadequate return for their produce.

Major Constraints

According to Agriculture Census 2010-11, the number of operational land holdings stood at 138.35 million with an average size of 1.15 hectares. Of the total holdings, 85% are in the marginal and small farmers’ categories of less than 2 hectares.

Seed is a critical and basic input for attaining higher yields and sustained growth in production. Distribution of assured quality seeds is as critical as the distribution of seeds. Unfortunately, good quality seeds are not within the reach of most farmers, especially small and marginal, because of exorbitant prices.

In spite of large-scale mechanisation in some parts of the country, there is less use of technology resulting in poor productivity. Also, farmers are still dependent on informal agencies for their credit needs despite a steady increase in the flow of rural credit from formal institutions. When the agriculturist’s capital is locked up in his lands and stocks, he is obliged to borrow money for stimulating the tempo of production.

Transforming Crucial

Transformation of the sector is crucial as 40% of households in the country depend on agriculture for their employment and livelihood. Research reveals that during the period of high agriculture growth (above 4%), almost half of it was driven by an increase in agricultural prices. Thus, if agricultural prices do not rise faster than other prices, there is a danger that the growth rate of agriculture will collapse, which then becomes a major cause of agrarian distress and impacts the overall economic growth.

A formidable and foremost challenge at present is how to sustain agriculture growth without letting food prices rise beyond acceptable limits and also to incentivise farmers to raise production without causing hardship to consumers. Hence, a shift in emphasis from growth to efficient growth is needed.

Successive surveys provide empirical evidence that there is a large-scale withdrawal by female labour from agriculture. However, such withdrawals have sharply decelerated while the shift of agriculture labour from the sector has accelerated.

India currently produces about 726 million tonnes of food to meet the demand of 1.3 billion people. Three-fourth proportion of this comprises food of plant origin (pulses, cereals, vegetables, etc) while the remaining comprises food of animal origin (milk, egg, fish etc). Agriculture will be required to produce 40.7% more food in the next 15 years to meet the domestic demand, which implies 2.3% annual growth. We will need about 1,016 million tonnes of food by 2031-32. Apart from meeting the agri-food production target, the real challenge comes from the composition of food and meeting nutrition requirements.

Agriculture accounts for more than 80% of total water use in the country. Still, more than 50% area under cultivation is without irrigation. Because of the common practice of flood irrigation, water use efficiency in the country is around 33%. Indian farmers use 2-times the water used to produce one tonne of food in major agricultural countries. Without modern irrigation facilities such as drip, sprinklers and sensors, the country cannot address the stress on water use.

Paradigm Shift

The National Agriculture Policy (July 2020) seeks to actualise the vast untapped potential of agriculture and aims at achieving a growth rate of 4% per annum in the sector with inclusiveness and equity. It emphasises the need to cater to domestic markets and maximise benefits from agri products. However, certain recommendations of the five reports of the Swaminathan Committee (2004-2006) need to be blended with the National Agriculture Policy to enhance productivity, profitability and sustainability of major farming systems.

The present challenges need to be converted into opportunities. Problems such as low wages, stress of manual work and irregular employment can be addressed by innovative approaches in production and post-harvest activities. These can be harnessed by developing and promoting new farm models based on knowledge and skill-based agriculture and post-harvest value-addition at the farm itself. The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana can play a vital role in this by promoting and imparting skills required in modern agriculture, value-addition and primary processing.

Food surplus has been continuously increasing for more than three decades. This requires a complete shift in food policy from shortage management to surplus management. We need to attain export competitiveness, and for this, the focus should be on three areas: Prices in primary markets should not be higher than international prices; price spread should be reduced and producers should be integrated with global chains.

Special focus is needed to raise the income of farmers at a much faster rate. This needs transformation of agriculture and marketing through a strategy that involves an increase in productivity, reduction in average cost, better price realisation for farm produce, expansion of allied activities and shift of farmers to non-farm activities.

Upgrading farming from low-tech to high-tech such as greenhouse cultivation, polyhouses, tissue culture, and precision farming will reduce average cost and enhance the income of farmers. Application of biotechnology will play an important role in shaping the future of agriculture. Agri-biotechnology occupied a back seat after the restrictions imposed on field testing and the non-release of Bt brinjal in the country. Countries which have embraced GM and genetically engineered technology have gained a lot in terms of productivity and cost. We must weigh the option for acceptance of biotech products vis a vis going back to indigenous technologies.

Use of nano-technology for the enhancement of food quality and safety, and the efficient use of inputs will be in near future. Nano-materials in agriculture will reduce wastage in the use of chemicals and also minimise nutrient losses in fertilization. This may also be used to increase yield through pest and nutrient management.

A well-coordinated strategy between the Centre and States is paramount to ensure that agriculture marches to the next stage of development along with secondary and tertiary sectors. Enhanced role of the private sector, active land lease market, formation of Farmers Producers Organisations and liberalised output market will help address these challenges.",['Telangana Today'],2022-09-06 00:30:56+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Farmer.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

Rajanna-Sircilla: IT Minister KT Rama Rao on Thursday lambasted the BJP-led union government for trying to privatise both the agriculture and power sectors, which he said would have a severely debilitating and far-reaching impact on farmers in the country.

”The Centre is conspiring to hand over both the agriculture and power sectors to corporate companies. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had warned about such a move on numerous occasions earlier, and his words are being proved true now,'” the Minister said.

Speaking to reporters in Sircilla on Thursday, Rama Rao said the union government, which was bent upon selling off all public sector undertakings, had decided to privatise even the process of crop procurement. The entry of private companies would hugely dent the income of farmers.

As per the Food Security Act, it was the responsibility of the union government to purchase each and every grain produced by farmers. However, the Centre was escaping from its responsibility and was now determined to privatise the power sector as well, he said, pointing out the firm stand of the Chief Minister against such reforms in the agriculture and power sectors, and recalled the State government’s resolution in the Assembly against the Power Bill.

Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had brought anti-farmer laws without knowing the ground reality, triggering the death of 700 farmers, the Minister said the union government was trying to weaken the agriculture and power sectors with its ‘inefficient and blunt’ decisions.

Due to the inefficiency of the Centre under the Modi regime, India was already ranked worse than Nigeria in terms of poverty ratio. India was also behind even Bangladesh and Pakistan in the Hunger Index, he said.

Stating that the agriculture sector was heading into a crisis due to the Centre’s policies, Rama Rao said farmers were going to become labourers in their own lands. In order to hand over the power sector to his corporate friends, Modi had decided to privatise power utilities in the name of reforms without consulting the public or even the Parliament.

“In order to weaken power generation units and help the coal business being done by his corporate friends, the Prime Minister is forcing the States to purchase coal from Australia by spending Rs.35,000 per tonne instead of domestic coal from Singareni Collieries Company Limited which is available at Rs.3,000 per tonne. He also lobbied for his friend in countries like Sri Lanka,” he said.

Rama Rao said the electricity reforms would have a severe adverse impact on Telangana. Besides the free power to the agriculture sector, the subsidy being provided to SC, ST, washermen, weavers and Nayi Brahmana (salons) communities and a few industries would have to be revoked if the new Electricity Bill was approved in the Parliament. He stated that the union government was also conspiring to weaken Telangana’s power units by creating hurdles in the sanction of loans to them.

“Why else is the Centre issuing gazettes through the backdoor and trying to privatise State power generation units,” he asked.

Cautioning that people would have to pay money in advance if pre-paid meters were fixed under the new Electricity Bill, he said the prices of electricity would be revised regularly akin to those of fuel, if private companies took over the power sector.

Asking the people to understand the conspiracy of the Centre, the Minister wanted all political parties to register their protest by setting aside differences for the interest of the State.",['Telangana Today'],2022-09-23 00:36:28+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KTR-15.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"
"KTR tele-talks to Munugode ryots, urges them to make wise choice","October 18, 2022 09:17 pm | Updated 09:17 pm IST - HYDERABAD

Working president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) K.T. Rama Rao spoke to farmers of the Munugode Assembly constituency going for by-election now in a teleconference held on Tuesday and asked them to make choice between 24x7 free power being given by the TRS Government to agricultural pump-sets or meters planned to be installed by the BJP Government.

He appealed to the farmers to compare the condition of farmers including supply of power, inputs and procurement after formation of the State in 2014 to the years before that and make a decision. He explained that the TRS Government was spending ₹10,500 crore a year on free power to agriculture and Telangana was the only State where uninterrupted free power was being given to farming in the country.

Besides, the State Government was also helping the farmers with investment support at the rate of ₹5,000 per acre before two crop season under Rythu Bandhu every year so that they need not depend on moneylenders and other creditors for procurement of inputs. The government had so far spent over ₹58,000 crore on Rythu Bandhu for nine crop seasons beginning with Kharif 2018.

Similarly, the TRS Government was implementing Rythu Bima life insurance cover to all landholding farmers under the age of 59 years and paying a claim of ₹5 lakh to the kin of a farmer on his/her death irrespective of the reason/cause, Mr. Rama Rao stated. He also told them that the government had spent over ₹1.17 lakh crore on procurement of paddy and other crops since 2014 including procurement done during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic.

To improve irrigation facilities in the constituency the government was constructing Shivannagudem and Krishnarayanipalle but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government at the Centre, on the other hand, was creating hurdles in completion of the two reservoirs as also delaying finalisation of State’s share in Krishna waters and withholding clearance to projects, he alleged.

On the adverse impact of installation of meters to farm pump-sets, Mr. Rama Rao told the farmers that they would get power supply to wet their crops only on making pre-payment as most of them do for mobile phone usage for their communication needs. He also cautioned the farmers that the BJP Government was also planning to scrap all welfare schemes for farmers with the sole objective of benefiting a couple of major corporate firms.",[],2022-10-18 15:47:29+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Munugode', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"
Agricultural university suspends 20 students for ragging juniors,"July 29, 2022 07:43 pm | Updated July 30, 2022 12:37 am IST - HYDERABAD

The College of Agriculture at the Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) has suspended 20 of its students from the hostel for allegedly ragging junior students.

The university issued an order to this effect on Thursday and it was disclosed to the media on Friday.

According to the order, the 20 students from the B.Sc (Hons) Agriculture course were allegedly involved in various forms of ragging, from minor to severe, such as making juniors write records to performing objectionable acts.

Seven of them, second and third year students, who reportedly engaged in severe ragging, were rusticated for the Semester-1 (2022-23), besides being suspended from the hostel till the end of their degree.

The Anti-Ragging Committee (ARC) also decided to suspend the 13 remaining students, who reportedly engaged in ‘minor ragging’, from the hostel till the end of their degree.

Complaint directed from Delhi

It was learnt that some of the aggrieved first year students had lodged a complaint with the National Anti-Ragging Helpline (1800-180-5522) and helpline@antiragging.in last week and sought intervention.

The PJTSAU was alerted last Saturday, following which the college’s ARC interacted with the students and enquired about related incidents. The aggrieved students had described the events of ragging, however, the alleged 20 students have denied all the allegations.

Officials said the college campus complies with the national anti-ragging policy. The campus is equipped with CCTV units that are integrated with the local police, the ARCs are functional and there were complaint boxes and campus helplines for students to reach out.

The PJTSAU said it has recorded two incidents of ragging this year – one at Jagtial and now at Rajendranagar. In both the cases, investigations were conducted and reports sent to the University Grants Commission.

On Friday, the National Anti-Ragging Helpline acknowledged PJTSAUs disciplinary action against the students and stated that the victims were satisfied and the complaint was closed.",[],2022-07-29 14:13:27+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Munugode', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"
Telangana government prods farmers to grow cotton this Kharif for greater profits,"Vivek Bhoomi By

Express News Service

HYDERABAD: In order to encourage farmers to grow cotton this Kharif season, the state government has rolled out a special scheme under which 2,615 crop colonies have been set up across the state. The role of Rythu Vedikas and agricultural extension officers is crucial in achieving the government’s objective of having the farmers cultivate cotton over 75-80 lakh acres in the State.

Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy, along with some MLAs and officials, recently conducted awareness programmes in Rangareddy, Nizamabad, Adilabad, Khammam and Mancherial districts on the benefits of growing cotton.

According to K Ramulu, Joint Director of Agriculture and Managing Director of TS Agro Industries Development Corporation Limited (TSAIDCL), an agricultural extension officer would be available at every Rythu Vedika at least once during the day. Also, crop bookings would be done online this time and farmers can directly contact the concerned officials. Ramulu told Express that Rythu Vedikas would conduct demonstrations for 50-100 farmers in every village to make farmers aware of the scientific advancements in agriculture and how it would benefit them in growing cotton.

On why such a major push was being given to cotton, he said that the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns in major cotton-producing countries like China, the Ukraine war, and the high quality of cotton produced in Telangana provide a great opportunity to the farmers of the State. “Cotton is selling at Rs 14,000 per quintal these days. If farmers get anything between Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000, it is a safe bet. I believe that there will be a huge international demand for cotton in the next few years,” he said.

“Another major advantage of growing this high-density plant is that the entire harvesting process will be completed in the second picking. There will be no need for third or fourth picking. The process will be done between November and December. That will save a lot of time,” Ramulu added.

The agriculture department is also encouraging farmers to go for high-density plantation of cotton as it could yield more than 2-3 quintals per acre. By detopping (cutting the terminal shoots of cotton plant), more yield can be achieved, officials said. Yet another advantage for growing cotton is that the stubble shredders are already available with the TSAIDCL. The stubble can be shaped into brick-sized mass that can be used as fire material in the pharma industry.

The agriculture departments is also mulling exporting cotton seeds for higher yields from US. “In Telangana, most of the land comes under small land holdings. To implement a one-time harvest, it requires large swathes of land. The seeds are also not available locally as of now,” said a scientist at Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University.

Nalgonda: Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs), who were in service since before 2014, felt that as a firsthand witnesses of pathetic conditions of the farmers in Telangana before formation of separate state, were feeling happy and working with satisfaction due to the change in the lives of the farmers due to irrigation facility, 24 hours electricity supply, Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bheema launched the state government.

When Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy interacted with the AEOs at a workshop on preparation for vanakalam crop season held here, the AEOs, who have been working since before formation of Telangana state, narrated the pathetic condition of the farmers in Telangana before 2014 and change in their lives after 2014.

An AEO Md Shafi, who was recruited in 2009, said that lack of irrigation facility and power cuts have badly impacted agriculture sector before 2014. Then, farmers made requests for financial help from the state government to save their families from financial crisis. When the minister questioned about the satisfaction levels in farmers, he said that the farmers were leading happy and dignified life due to the initiatives of the farmers. When the minister questioned what incident bothered him during the duty, he said that suicides of farmers have pained him very much.

When the minister questioned what made them feel happy in their service, another AEO of Mudigonda cluster Anjaneeyulu said that the farmers nowadays need not go to agricultural pumsets in night time now due to uninterrupted electricity supply. His father was also a farmer and was forced to go to fields at 11 pm to switch on pump sets and his family member spent time with fear until his father returned to the house in the night. Earlier, a bore well was capable of catering to the irrigation needs of 10 to 15 guntas of land. But now cultivation could be taken up in acres with a single bore well due to improved ground water level, he added. These factors have changed the lives of the farmers in rural areas, he added.

The minister was impressed when a woman AEO of Vangapally cluster in Yadadri-Bhongir district, Shravya said that she was not interested to apply for recently released TSPSC Group-I notification due satisfaction in serving the farmers in the present job.",['Telangana Today'],2022-06-01 22:51:07+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/workshop-for-AEOs-nalgonda-.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Mudigonda', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Munugode', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Mancherial', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Uppal', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Mancherial', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Medak']"

"Eight Years Of Telangana: The Hits, The Misses, And The Challenges Ahead","On June 2nd, 2014, Telangana State was formed by dividing Andhra Pradesh after a prolonged struggle for a separate State.

Unlike the new States, which typically face 'capital' crunch in terms of both city and money, Telangana was formed with the well developed mega city of Hyderabad as its capital. It positioned the new State financially on better terms.

The first Chief Minister (CM) of Telangana, K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), who led the latter phase of the Telangana movement with 'Neellu, Nidhulu and Niyamakalu' (Water, Funds and Jobs) used the available financial resources to fulfil his poll promises and some objectives of the struggle for a separate State.

The main achievements of Telangana as a separate State can be broadly classified under the headings 'Economy', 'Electricity' and 'Empowerment'.

Economy

Telangana has consistently recorded high GDP growth in the last eight years on the economic front. Its GDP growth at constant prices (2011-12) increased from 6.8 per cent in 2014-15 to 11.2 per cent in 2021-22, and the youngest State's contribution to India's GDP at Current Prices raised from 4.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent between 2014-15 and 2021-22.

In these eight years, Telangana's GSDP at current prices has more than doubled from Rs 5.1 lakh crore to Rs 11.6 lakh crore.

Similarly, the state's Per Capita Income (PCI) at Current Prices has more than doubled from Rs 1,24,104 in 2014-15 to Rs 2,78,833 in 2021-22. In comparison, the all India PCI at Current Prices has not even doubled in this period.

Also, the share of the agriculture and allied sectors in the total Gross State Value Added (GSVA) of the State increased from 16.3 per cent in 2014-15 to 18.3 per cent in 2021-22.

The development of agriculture is crucial for Telangana as the sector employs 48.4 per cent of the state's population.

But challenges like regional inequality in growth and attracting investments remain in Telangana. For example, between 2015 to January 2022, districts like Sangareddy and Rangareddy attracted investments of over Rs 16,000 crore in the industrial sector, but districts like Mulugu and Adilabad have not received even Rs 100 crore as investments.

Electricity

An increase in 'Electricity' production is one of the state's significant achievements. Telangana is a semi-arid and plateau region with rivers like Godavari and Krishna flowing at a much lower surface level than most of the state, making the state's agriculture sector dependent on borewells.

The State government's move to provide 24-hour free electricity to farmers offered respite. To implement this, the State government has primarily focused on the power sector in its initial years.

Telangana used to experience a peak demand shortage of 2,700 MW and a load relief of 4-8 hours at the time of its formation in 2014. Also, industries in the State had to experience two power holidays a week.

The State government's focus and the union government's cooperation led to the installed capacity of power in Telangana increasing from 9,470 MW in 2014-15 to 17,218 MW in 2020-21.

With this, Telangana has emerged as the only state to supply 24x7 free power to 25.92 lakh agricultural consumers and uninterrupted supply to both industrial and service sectors.

From 2014-15, the State government has incurred an expenditure of Rs 39,200 crore on subsidies to the agriculture sector for the free power supply. At the all India level, Telangana consumes the highest percentage (41.25 per cent) of electricity for agriculture purposes (24077 GWh out of total energy sold of 58,365 GWh).

But this primacy of agriculture in the power sector fuelled by subsidies could become an irrevocable burden on the state finance in the long run.

Also, the dominance of thermal power (55 per cent) is not such a progressive factor. The share of Renewable Energy in the total Installed Capacity of Telangana is 22 per cent (lowest in southern Indian states), while it is 65 per cent in neighbouring Karnataka.

Empowerment

Since 2014, the reorganisation of administration by increasing the number of districts from 10 to 33 has brought the seats of power nearer to the public. This move coupled with consistently high economic growth, has helped increase land prices throughout the state.

Many efforts by the state government, like agriculture investment support of Rs 10,000 per acre each year, under the Rythu Bandhu scheme, to 63 lakh beneficiaries; increase in overall gross irrigated area from 62.48 lakh acres (in 2014-15) to 136.86 lakh acres (in 2020-21) by commissioning and completion of irrigation schemes and projects like Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation project, renovation of 27,665 minor irrigation tanks and water bodies under 'Mission Kakatiya,' etc. has economically empowered the agriculture-dependent rural Telangana.

The introduction of initiatives such as TS iPASS to provide clearances to all projects within 30 days has empowered entrepreneurs in the state. Between 2014-15 and 2021-22, 18,761 proposals with an investment of Rs.2,26,806 crore were approved under TS iPASS.

The empowerment of youth by increasing job opportunities is another achievement since the formation of Telangana. For example, in the IT sector alone, jobs have increased from 3.7 lakh to 6.28 lakh between 2014-15 and 2020-21.

Under Mission Bhagiratha, launched in 2016, the Telangana government provided tap water to every household in 23,890 rural and 121 urban habitations. According to the centre's Jal Jeevan Mission data, households with functional tap connections are 100 per cent in the state. This mission has empowered women to some extent by decreasing their effort to procure water for their households.

But the challenges like rising income inequality, allegations of concentration of power and failure to increase government job recruitment which is one of the main demands of the Telangana movement, are derailing the progress on this front.","['Gampa Sai Datta', 'Gampa Sai Datta Covers Infrastructure Issues For Swarajya', 'India Infra Hub.

Telangana Development Forum (TDF) USA inaugurated the TDF Jaikisan Agriculture Custom Hiring Centre (CHC) at Mustabad

Hyderabad: Telangana Development Forum (TDF) USA inaugurated the TDF Jaikisan Agriculture Custom Hiring Centre (CHC) at Mustabad in Rajanna Siricilla. CHC will facilitate farm equipment to small and medium farmers and promote natural farming.

While SERP is promoting CHC with 40℅ subsidy for group farmers, it is limited to one unit per district. To overcome this limitation, TDF USA has come forward to set up CHC in rural villages.

There is a labour shortage and costs are too high for the small and mid-sized farmers. As a result, the earnings from the farm operations are decreasing. Many are opting out of agriculture due to high costs.

TDF Jaikisan has been supporting the farm sector since Telangana formed, said TDF India General Secretary Matta Rajeshwar Reddy. Use of pesticides is affecting the health of farmers and consumers apart from causing soil and environment pollution, he said.

Newly elected TDF USA President Dr Divesh R Anireddy urged the farmers to use the agri-equipment available at the CHC. Newly elected Jaikisan chair Pati Narender assured that TDF Jaikisan projects would be taken up in more villages.

Telangana CM KCR orders release of paddy procurement dues to farmers after BJP letter,"The state unit of BJP Wednesday appealed to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government to immediately release the payments due to the farmers for paddy procured from them during the Rabi season, setting off an exchange of allegations between both the parties.

However, even amid the war of words, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed officials to deposit the Rythu Bandhu Scheme amount to the bank accounts of the farmers so that they can start sowing Kharif crops from June 28. “As per the CM’s directions to Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Rythu Bandhu funds will be deposited in the farmers’ accounts in a phased manner,” a CMO official said.

In a letter written to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar said the state government had taken up the purchase of paddy produced during the Rabi season after a prolonged struggle by the BJP. Telangana Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy gave a strong counter saying that the BJP leaders should not talk anything regarding paddy in Telangana. “The BJP-led Centre deceived Telangana farmers by not procuring paddy. How can BJP leaders even comment on payments to the farmers? Did they even bother to talk to the farmers? The process of paying the farmers is already going on,” he said.

Civil Supplies Minister Gangula Kamlakar was livid that the BJP was making misleading statements. “The Telangana government is purchasing every grain of paddy from the state farmers as our CM had promised to, even though the Centre ditched these paddy farmers by not purchasing their produce. We stand by our commitment to the farmers to purchase and pay for every grain we purchase and the process is going on. BJP has no reason to complain after deceiving the farmers,” he said.

Bandi Sanjay Kumar, however, alleged that in many districts, the government had not made payments to the farmers towards the paddy procured from them, causing a lot of anxiety for them. “As the Kharif season has commenced, the farmers don’t have money to take up cultivation, as a result of which, they are forced to depend on private money lenders,” he said.

Sanjay said the farmers did not receive the money for the paddy they had produced during the Rabi season and the state government is yet to make payments under the Rythu Bandhu scheme for the Kharif season. “Taking advantage of their situation, the private money lenders are charging high interests on the crop loans,” he said.

Bandi Sanjay Kumar said that in the four districts of Karimnagar, Peddapalli, Jagtial and Rajanna Sircilla, the state government had procured 11.2 lakh metric tonne of paddy from 1,91,852 farmers through 1,286 procurement centres. The total cost of the paddy was Rs 2,197.16 crore but the government is still to pay Rs 517.16 crore to the farmers.

Stating that the Telangana government had little concern towards the farming community, Sanjay said it was unfortunate that neither the agriculture minister nor the officials of the department had made any field visits to understand the farmers’ problems even after the commencement of the Kharif season.

He demanded that the government should immediately release the money due to the farmers for the Rabi season paddy, besides taking steps to arrange for seeds and fertilisers to them at the earliest, so that they could commence the agriculture operations. Sanjay also wanted the district collectors to hold meetings with all farmers’ associations and political parties to discuss the farmers’ issues and extend them the input cost.","['Sreenivas Janyala', 'Var Template_Content', 'Sso_Login_Box', 'Xwelcome Backorenter The Email Address Or Mobile Number Associated With Your Account To Sign In.

"Rain continues to affect normal life, damages crops in Telangana","July 12, 2022 09:14 pm | Updated 09:14 pm IST - HYDERABAD

Normal life continues to remain affected in many parts of Telangana for the fifth day in a row with heavy to very heavy rains lashing different parts of the State on Tuesday. Incessant rain also damaged standing crops, most of which are in the initial plant growth stage, and also impacted the sowing operations.

In Jagitial district, nine farmhands were stranded on an island in a rivulet course at Bornapally in Raikal mandal. Efforts were on to rescue them with the help of boats by NDRF team, as sending a helicopter was ruled out due to inclement weather. Minister for SC Development K. Eshwar stated that there was no threat to the life of those stranded as the island with over 200 acres of farm lands has no threat of submergence and there were permanent structures for their stay.

Cultivation of crops this Kharif season, already lesser by over 4.2 lakh acres till the last week compared to the same period last year, and the recommended period for sowing of cotton, soybean, green gram and black gram would end with July 15. Delayed sowing of these crops would face the threat of heavy damage due to monsoon retreat and cyclonic rains in October, Agriculture Department officials said.

Against the Agriculture Department’s advice to farmers to take up cotton cultivation in about 70 lakh acres this season, it was not even half (31.87 lakh acres) that extent till the commencement of rains last week. The rains have also inundated and silted the standing crops in large extents in northern districts, mostly along the courses of rivers or rivulets.

Irrigation projects

Meanwhile, with the forecast of heavy flood from the upstream Maharashtra, the authorities of Sriramsagar have decided to keep ample flood cushion in the project by discharging over 81,100 cusecs for 26 spillway gates, 6,000 cusecs with power generation and 15,000 cusecs to Flood Flow Canal, although inflow was 75,700 cusecs at 7 pm.

Except Ramappa lake, 28 other medium irrigation projects in the Godavari Basin have already become surplus or reaching that stage. Against their capacity of 46.65 tmcft, storage was 37.4 tmcft on Tuesday with total inflow of nearly 2.79 lakh cusecs and outflow at 2.58 lakh cusecs. All the eight medium projects in the Krishna Basin too are in a similar stage with total inflow of 2.95 lakh cusecs and outflow of 2.72 lakh cusecs.

With the commencement of spillway discharge of flood at Tungadhadra dam on Tuesday evening and at Almatti-Narayanpur on Monday evening, Jurala-Srisailam are set to receive heavy flood early from Wednesday. The authorities at Jurala have started emptying the dam through power generation at 6X39 megawatt hydel station from Monday night starting with 2 units first. It is also allowing power generation at the 6X40 MW Lower Jurala hydel station in the downstream.",[],2022-07-12 15:44:04+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Raikal', 'Mudigonda', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Munugode', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Mancherial', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Chennur', 'Uppal', 'Mustabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Mancherial', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Rajanna Sircilla', 'Medak']"
Steep decline in farmers’ suicide in Telangana: Tomar,"HYDERABAD: The Centre on Tuesday informed Parliament that farmers' suicides in Telangana witnessed a steep decline since 2015.

Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar gave a written reply in Lok Sabha to this effect to the question raised by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and MP A. Revanth Reddy.

Revanth Reddy sought to know the details of the number of farmers who had committed suicide in Telangana since 2014, the major reasons behind such suicides, the details of the steps taken and schemes launched by the Centre to stop such suicides, the number of farmers benefitted from such schemes and whether the Centre had given any compensation to the families of the victim farmers.

Citing the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the ministry of home affairs statistics, Tomar replied that Telangana witnessed 898 suicides by farmers in 2014, the year of formation of Telangana state, which jumped to 1,358 in 2015. Later, it fell sharply to 632 in 2016 but rose to 846 and 900 in 2017 and 2018 respectively. However, farmers' suicides again fell sharply to 491 in 2019 and further came down to 466 in 2020.

Tomar said the NCRB compiles and disseminates information on suicides in its publication titled ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India’ (ADSI). The NCRB has published reports up to 2020 which are available on its website. The NCRB does not publish district-wise data of suicides by farmers.

He said the reasons of farmers suicide were given in the ADSI report 2014 and 2015. As per the ADSI reports for the years 2014 and 2015, the major causes of farmers’ suicide were bankruptcy or indebtedness, farming-related issues, family problems and illness, etc, he added.

""Agriculture being a state subject, the state governments take appropriate measures for development of agriculture. However, the government of India supplements the efforts of states through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support and various schemes and programmes,"" Tomar stated.

The various schemes and programmes of the government of India were meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers. The Centre had initiated various interventions and projects for the welfare of farmers such as PM-KISAN, minimum support price (MSP) by providing minimum 50 per cent return over cost of production, soil health card (SHC), neem coated urea, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinhchayee Yojana (PMKSY), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Regions (MOVCDNER), Mission Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Integrated Pest Management, Integrated Nutrient Management, National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Watershed Development Project, Sub-mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM) and Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), Sub-mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP), Per Drop More Crop (PDMC-PMKSY), Kisan Credit Card (KCC) and Interest Subvention Scheme, he explained.

Further, the Centre supported these schemes by providing higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources such as creating corpus funds like micro-irrigation fund, agriculture infrastructure funds, PM matasya sampadana yojana, animal husbandry infrastructure development fund and formation of FPOs, Gramin Agriculture Markets etc.

However, Tomar clarified that agriculture being a state subject, the state governments provide relief to kin of the farmers who committed suicide.",[],2022-04-05 23:36:00+05:30,https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-5n5lp137v7plr9g0v2ek6v2cc3-20210912095941.Medi.jpeg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Raikal', 'Mudigonda', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Munugode', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Mancherial', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Chennur', 'Uppal', 'Mustabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Mancherial', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Rajanna Sircilla', 'Medak']"

"Gujarat polls: As joblessness bothers BJP, it pins hope on Hindutva to make clean sweep in Sabarkantha","Gujarat polls: As joblessness bothers BJP, it pins hope on Hindutva to make clean sweep in Sabarkantha

The Congress is hopeful of improving its tally from the single seat it had won last time and is carrying out a silent campaign in the rural areas of the district.

By PTI Updated On - 03:19 PM, Sat - 3 December 22

Sabarkantha: The Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat is hoping to make a clean sweep in the Dalit and tribal-dominated Sabarkantha district comprising four Assembly constituencies even as unemployment has become a major issue that the ruling party hopes to negate with Hindutva and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s charisma.

The Congress is hopeful of improving its tally from the single seat it had won last time and is carrying out a silent campaign in the rural areas of the district.

Although the Aam Aadmi Party is in the fray in the district, apart from the Khedbrahma seat, it is not a factor in the remaining three, whereas independents from Congress and the BJP might play a spoilsport for both the parties in two seats.

Sabarkantha, which goes to polls in the second phase on December 5, comprises Himatnagar, Idar, Khedbrahma and Prantij assembly segments. Except for Khedbrahma, known as a Congress bastion, the saffron camp had won the remaining three in 2017.

The district has around 11 lakh voters spread across, of whom Scheduled Tribes comprise 30 per cent.

The Scheduled Caste community accounts for 20 per cent of the total electorate, Muslims around two per cent, Patels 10 per cent, while the remaining include Kshatriya, Rajput, Koli, Brahmins and other communities.

Nearly 85 per cent of the voters live in rural areas, and the district’s economy revolves around agriculture, small business, the ceramics industry in Himatnagar and milk processing.

Although SCs, Kshatriyas, Brahmins, and Rajputs have been the committed voters of the saffron camp for the last two decades, a large section of the influential Patidar community, which was with the BJP till 2012, went against the saffron camp following the quota agitation.

The Congress has been the first choice of the STs in the district, the Koli community, and minorities.

As unemployment has emerged as a major issue in the district, the BJP is banking on Hindutva and Modi factor and wooing voters with promises of setting up industries.

“We are confident of making a clean sweep this time. People here identify themselves with our ideology, and PM Modi has a huge following here, just like any other part of the state. We have promised to set up big manufacturing units in the area, so youths don’t have to go anywhere else,” BJP leader Vijay Pandya said.

Sabarkantha district, which also bore the brunt of the 2002 post-Godhra riots, has a strong support base of the BJP among Dalits and other communities. Some of the ‘kar sevaks’, who died in the Godhra train burning incident, were from the district. However, tribals here have been divided between Congress and the BJP. The minorities’ are a minuscule population who migrated to other areas after the riots in the district.

The tribals of Khedbrahma have been committed voters of the Congress for the last several elections, whereas in Idar and other constituencies, it votes for the BJP.

“As long as BJP is here, the Hindus are safe in the district. Sabarkantha is an example of how strong the brotherhood of Hindutva ideology can be,” said a BJP leader, who did not wish to be named.

Another major stumbling block for the saffron camp in this district is infighting and resentment among workers over the selection of candidates.

In Khedbrahma, the BJP that has been yearning to win, inducted three-term Congress MLA Ashvin Kotwal into the party and gave him a ticket from the constituency, thus angering a section of ticket aspirants and old-timers in the party.

This seat has the highest concentration of tribals in the area and is reserved for the Scheduled Tribes (ST) community. The AAP might be a factor in the seat as it has put up a local tribal leader as its candidate.

In Idar seat, a stronghold of BJP since the nineties, the party has given a ticket to its former MLA Ramanlal Vora, replacing its sitting MLA and actor Hitu Kanodia.

Vora is the tallest Dalit leader of the party in the district.

The community is visibly upset with the performance of the BJP in the area and the Congress hopes to work on it with the help of the Patel community.

“The BJP MLA has done nothing for us. Earlier it was Voraji, then Hitu Kanodia. The constituency faces an issue of unemployment and inflation,” said Veljibhai Parmar, a resident of the Ider constituency.

In Himatnagar, the BJP has dropped its sitting MLA and given the ticket to a party old-timer Virendrasinh Zala. In this seat, Congress has pitted Kamlesh Kumar Patel.

Apart from resentment over the selection of the candidate, the trend of the seat changing hands alternatively for the last few elections, except in 2014 bypolls, when Congress MLA who switched over to the saffron camp won on a BJP ticket, is a cause of worry for the BP.

Just like the entire state, the Congress in Sabarkantha is also carrying out a silent campaign by reaching out to the masses in the region, trying to encash anti-incumbency against the BJP and with the promise of job creation for the youths in the region.

“The BJP has done nothing to create jobs in the district. Most youths travel to other parts of the state or country for employment. The BJP’s campaign of Hindutva and Narendra Modi magic won’t work this time,” district Congress President Suresh Patel said.

In the 2019 national elections, the BJP won the Sabarkantha Lok Sabha seat, which it has been winning since 2009, by pocketing more than 57 per cent of the total votes polled, whereas the Congress bagged just 35 per cent of the votes polled.

The Sabarkantha Lok Sabha seat was thrice represented by Gulzarlal Nanda, who twice became interim prime minister.

While the first phase of the Assembly polls was conducted on December 1, the second phase will be held on December 5. The votes will be counted on December 8.",['Telangana Today'],2022-12-03 15:19:21+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BJP-9.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Raikal', 'Mudigonda', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Munugode', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Mancherial', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Chennur', 'Uppal', 'Mustabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Mancherial', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Rajanna Sircilla', 'Medak']"

A tiger was sighted in different parts of Easgaon village in Kaghaznagar mandal on Friday evening and Saturday morning, triggering panic among locals.

By Telangana Today Updated On - 08:50 PM, Sat - 19 November 22

Kumram Bheem Asifabad: A tiger was sighted in different parts of Easgaon village in Kaghaznagar mandal on Friday evening and Saturday morning, triggering panic among locals. The same tiger is suspected to have mauled a tribal farmer to death at Gondapur village in Wankidi mandal on Tuesday.

Titled A3, the tiger was spotted near village, where most of the residents are refugees, early on Saturday morning. It then moved to Raspalli, Anukoda villages in Kaghaznagar mandal and headed to Sirpur (T) covering a distance of 45 kilometres. The sighting of the tiger triggered panic among locals and farmers who were harvesting cotton and paddy crops.

The tiger earlier strayed into the forests of Vempalli village in Sirpur (T) mandal and in agriculture fields of Shivapuram and Bareguda villages on Friday night after drifting towards this region from Wankidi on Thursday.

It is said to have entered the forests of Telangana from Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Chandrapur of neighboring Maharashtra state in search of territory, and is alleged to have killed Sidam Bheem when he was picking cotton balls. There are also doubts that Bheem was killed by a leopard.

A team of Forest officials led by in-charge District Forest Officer G Dinesh Kumar have been camping in Kaghaznagar since Thursday evening. They launched a special operation to track the movement of the tiger and to avoid human loss. They are planning to capture it if there are any more attacks on humans.

Dinesh Kumar said animal trackers were deployed and CCTV cameras were set up in several parts of Kaghaznagar forest division to track the movement of the tiger and to prevent harm to the animal.

He urged the rural folks and farmers not to venture outdoors after 8 pm and to move in groups. They advised farmers to return from agriculture fields before 6 pm.

Authorities of the forest department believe that the tiger was trying to establish a territory. They feel that it may be facing territorial conflict with the S-9 tiger which had already settled in the forests of Asifabad division and drifted towards the wild of Kaghaznagar division.",['Telangana Today'],2022-11-19 20:50:09+05:30,https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Tiger-continues-to-roam.jpg,[],[],,"['Jagtial', 'Raikal', 'Mudigonda', 'Wankidi', 'Peddapalli', 'Rajendranagar', 'Wanaparthy', 'Mahadevpur', 'Sangareddy', 'Mulug', 'Karimnagar', 'Dichpally', 'Hayathnagar', 'Dharmaram', 'Kothagudem', 'Narayanpet', 'Gadwal', 'Sirikonda', 'Vikarabad', 'Bayyaram', 'Kamareddy', 'Khanapur', 'Bhadrachalam', 'Warangal', 'Krishna', 'Munugode', 'Basar', 'Narnoor', 'Sircilla', 'Srirangapur', 'Medchal', 'Doulthabad', 'Asifabad', 'Chandrugonda', 'Nalgonda', 'Bodhan', 'Nirmal', 'Ramagundam', 'Boath', 'Kukatpally', 'Mancherial', 'Koheda', 'Bhainsa', 'Suryapet', 'Singareni', 'Chennur', 'Uppal', 'Mustabad', 'Huzurabad', 'Medak']","['Jagtial', 'Bhadradri Kothagudem', 'Peddapalli', 'Wanaparthy', 'Siddipet', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Narayanpet', 'Vikarabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Jogulamba Gadwal', 'Nagarkurnool', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Nalgonda', 'Nirmal', 'Mancherial', 'Rangareddy', 'Suryapet', 'Mulugu', 'Rajanna Sircilla', 'Medak']"

Hyderabad: In a brazen attempt to pull the wool over people’s eyes, the Centre made a tall claim of doubling the farmers’ income, without however, mentioning where the tectonic change has occurred in the lives of farmers. The hollow claim made in a tweet by the Agriculture Ministry on Saturday, elicited derisive comments from twitterati and a sharp rebuke from Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president and minister K T Rama Rao.

The controversial tweet by union Agriculture ministry claimed that “In response to the PM’s clarion call for doubling the farmers’ income, the income of very large number of farmers has more than doubled”. The tweet, however, did not speak about any data to substantiate the tall claim. Incidentally, a model’s photograph was used convey the image of a smiling farmer, but twitterati did not lose much time in castigating the Centre’s attempt to peddle untruths using models.

In a scathing attack on Centre on its latest claim of doubling farmers’ income, KT Rama Rao used the same medium – twitter, to call a spade a spade. In his tweet, he asked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to share the details as to how many millions of farmers’ income was doubled in the country and details of States from which these farmers hailed. He also sought to know which initiative of the Government was the key to achieve the feat.

If the claim 👇of the Agriculture Dept is true, I request the Hon’ble @PMOIndia to furnish the details to the people of this country 1) How many millions of farmers doubled their Income?

2) Which state are these farmers from?

3) Which initiative of Govt was key to achieve this? https://t.co/5mTGmJtw3D — KTR (@KTRTRS) July 16, 2022

The Agriculture Ministry’s tweet, without any backup data, was subject of ridicule in an avalanche of comments. “Shouldn’t the agriculture sector of GDP have a growth rate of around 9% to double the income of farmers in eight years since 2014? I never knew our agriculture sector has started growing more than other two sectors,” tweeted Makarand Desai.

It was not just the farmers’ income tweet that was lampooned by K T Rama Rao in his tweets. He took a dig at the Prime Minister for imposing restrictions on usage of a few expressions in the Parliament and the foul language used by a few BJP leaders.

Parliamentary language of NPA Govt ✅ PM calling protesters “Andolan Jeevi” is fine

✅” Goli Maaron Saalon Ko” by Minister is okay

✅ “80-20” by UP Chief Minister is okay

✅ Denigration of Mahatma Gandhi by BJP MP is fine

✅ Farmer protesters insulted as “Terrorists” is fine pic.twitter.com/0Q4nfUmuET — KTR (@KTRTRS) July 16, 2022
