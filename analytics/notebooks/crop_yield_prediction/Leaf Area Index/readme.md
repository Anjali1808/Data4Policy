The aim of this folder is to create a GeoTiff or COG file for Leaf Area Index that can be used to improve the DiCRA platform.

We derive LAI 300metres data from: https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lai

Then, we convert this data from netCDF to GeoTiff in 'LAI_preprocessing.ipynb'. 
The result as provided in 'T_LAI.tif' contains the Leaf Area Index for Telangana.
