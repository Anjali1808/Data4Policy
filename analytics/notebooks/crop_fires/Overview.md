Research:

- How can we identify farming communities that are over time reducing the impact on the environment and health by curbing crop residue burning?
- Can non-traditional data sources help in identifying what they are doing or what changes have happened in their economic or social situation compared to communities that are still practicing crop/stubble burning?
- Identify datasets that can help quantify the practice of crop burning among rice farmers in India? This also calls for identifying areas under rice, cropping patterns, air quality indicators, etc.
- Identify positive deviant rice farms in India practicing Climate Smart Agriculture using non-traditional data sources such as mobile phone records, satellite imagery, social media, online data, or financial data.
- Identify changes in socio-economic or policy aspects in regions that are showing positive deviance.
- Diversifying crops, using crop residue for alternate purposes, in-situ management of crop residue, policy measures, etc. are recommended by officials to reduce crop burning. Can data sources help identify such practices and adaptations by communities?

Approach:

1) Overview of all available data
2) Literature Research about Positive Deviance Modelling 
3) Identify datasets that can quantify the practice of crop burning (areas under rice, cropping patterns, air quality indicators)
4) Identify factors in socio-economic or policy aspects regarding positive deviance
5) Literature Research crop residue alternative purposes & their impact
6) Modeling Positive Deviance
