# Peer Review Guidelines for DiCRA

Data in Climate Resilient Agriculture (DiCRA) is a collaborative digital public good that provides open access to key geospatial datasets pertinent to climate-resilient agriculture. These datasets are curated and validated through the collaborative efforts of hundreds of data scientists and citizen scientists across the world. The pattern detection and data insights emerging from DiCRA are aimed toward strengthening evidence-driven policy-making for climate-resilient food systems.  

DiCRA is guided by the digital public good principles of open access, open software, open code, and open APIs and is accredited as a Global Digitial Public Good. For curating, and preprocessing datasets, doing analytics on different parameters, and developing open machine Learning algorithms, DiCRA works with a community of students and researchers from India and abroad.  

We invited applications from the open-source community to put together a panel of peer-reviewers with expertise in Agronomy and/or Geospatial technologies and/or Data Science who  review, and provide feedback to our community. 

If you are interested to be part of this exciting community of practice and actively participating in the peer-review process, please fill out the [form](https://forms.gle/E9ys3dNjwYTkhfnp9).


### Guidelines
- We expect a maximum of 8-16 hours of time spent per year by this team of experts who will review the analytics uploaded in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/undpindia/dicra) and use cases being developed in DiCRA. We will typically meet 1-2 times per year as a group (virtually) to discuss, and strategise and individual calls might be scheduled as and when necessary based on the availability of the peer-reviewer.
- Each layer will be peer-reviewed by atleast 2 panel members
- The automation pipeline for the data layer, Data Powered Positive Deviance Analysis, Trend, and the Use Case deployment with the data layer will be tested and provided feedback for by the reviewer using a standard google form developed by the DiCRA collaborative.

In addition to reviewing code, the peer-review panel members will support the DiCRA data collaborate to
- Identify specific data gaps and needs, and potential data sources
- Provide input to develop targeted analytics layers
- Identify potential use cases where DiCRA data stack can be 
- Make recommendations to improve the UI/UX of the DiCRA Platform
