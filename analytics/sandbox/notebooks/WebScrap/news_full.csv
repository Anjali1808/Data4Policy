"Telangana floods: State pegs losses at Rs 1,400 crore, seeks Rs 1,000 crore immediate central aid","The Telangana government has sought immediate financial assistance of Rs 1,000 crore from the Centre, after arriving at an estimated loss of Rs 1,400 crore to floods in its northern and eastern districts last week.

A statement from the Chief Minister’s Office said Wednesday that the state government has submitted a report to the Centre of the preliminary estimations of flood losses in the natural calamity.

Incessant rains across the state’s northern and eastern districts had inundated and cut-off villages in low-lying areas disrupting power, water and supply of essentials and leading to widespread flooding. Farmers across the state are worried about their crops as their fields were flooded at the beginning of the season itself.

Meanwhile, a team of experts designated to assess the flood-related damages in the state and submit a report to the Centre is expected to arrive in Hyderabad Thursday.

During the week, nearly 30,000 people were relocated to rescue camps. At least 15 lives were lost and the Bhadradri Kothagudem district, where flood waters in the River Godavari touched 71 feet against a third level warning of 53 feet, was the worst affected. Adilabad, Jayashankar Bhupalapally, Komaram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, Mulugu, Nirmal, and Peddapalli were also battered by heavy rain.

Giving detail, the state government said the Roads and Buildings Department has incurred a loss of Rs 498 crore towards roads and causeways that were washed away. Panchayat Raj Department suffered a loss of Rs 449 crore, followed by the Municipal Administration Department which pegged its losses at Rs 379 crore. Similarly, the Irrigation Department has prepared losses to the tune of Rs 33 crore, whereas Energy Department pitched a figure of Rs 7 crore.

The preliminary estimation of losses incurred by these departments was compiled and presented to the Centre. The state government said it has also estimated a loss of Rs 25 crore to submergence of villages, incidents of house collapse and evacuation and relocation of the victims.

Following respite from the floods, the Health Department has been conducting health camps across the 8 worst-affected districts. The department along with district collectors prepared an action plan to prevent seasonal diseases by dividing flood-affected areas into 4 geographical regions. Rapid response teams are deployed and a special focus has been given to 297 high-risk areas. A house-to-house fever survey is also underway.","['Var Template_Content', 'Sso_Login_Box', 'Xwelcome Backorenter The Email Address Or Mobile Number Associated With Your Account To Sign In.

TRS suspends Kothagudem MLA’s son,"January 07, 2022 07:17 pm | Updated 07:17 pm IST - HYDERABAD

The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) suspended party leader from Bhadradri-Kothagudem district Vanama Raghavendra Rao alias Raghava, who is also the son of party MLA from Kothagudem Vanama Venkateswara Rao, with immediate effect on Friday.

Raghava is facing charges of threatening with life and abetment to suicide by a family in a property dispute case. The issue came to light after a selfie-video by victim Naga Ramakrishna was circulated of him along with his wife and two children ending their lives.

Acting on the instruction of party president K. Chandrasekhar Rao, general secretary of the party Palla Rajeshwar Reddy and in-charge of party affairs in Bhadradri-Kothagudem N. Naresh Reddy suspended Raghava from TRS.

Raghava’s father Mr. Venkateswara Rao was elected to the Assembly on a Congress ticket in the December 2018 elections but joined the ruling party along with six other MLAs later.

Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders from Khammam joined the TRS in the presence of party working president and Minister for IT and Industries K.T. Rama Rao and Minister for Transport Puvvada Ajay Kumar, who also represents Khammam constituency in the Assembly, here on Friday.

According to party leaders, Congress corporators of Khammam Municipal Corporation M. Shravani (55th division) and D. Radha (17th division) as also Sarpanch of Budidampadu village in Raghunadhapalem mandal Meera and several others formally joined TRS.

Mr. Rama Rao said that the Chief Minister had introduced several welfare schemes for the poor in rural and urban areas and developed towns by upgrading several of them as municipalities and several tandas as gram panchayats.

While farmers had committed suicide due to distress and people faced difficulties in the absence of basic amenities during the previous Congress rule, the TRS government had been providing investment support under Rythu Bandhu, free uninterrupted power supply to agriculture, new roads to villages and tandas, constructed drainages, graveyards and developed village parks, he said.",[],2022-01-07 13:47:45+00:00,https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],[],,"Mancherial,Peddapalli,Dummugudem,Sircilla,Karimnagar,Tirumalayapalem,Kamareddy,Sangareddy,Aswapuram,Raghunadhapalem,Mulug,Asifabad,Jagtial,Gundala,Nirmal,Medak,Kothagudem,Yellandu,Allapalli,Cherla,Gadwal,Krishna,Bhadrachalam","Khammam,Mulugu,Rajanna Sircilla,Karimnagar,Hyderabad,Bhadradri Kothagudem,Sangareddy,Jogulamba Gadwal,Siddipet,Kamareddy,Mancherial,Nirmal,Medak,Peddapalli,Adilabad,Jagtial,Nizamabad"

"High wages, heatwave hit poultry farmers","Although the price of broiler chicken touched Rs 250 per kilogram, farmers said that the high prices are not trickling down to them and only traders are benefitting. (Representational Image/ AFP)

Khammam: Poultry farmers in Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts have decided to temporarily suspend production of broiler chicken due to hiked labour costs and increased bird deaths during summer.

Although the price of broiler chicken touched Rs 250 per kilogram, farmers said that the high prices are not trickling down to them and only traders are benefitting.

At present, there are 20 lakh birds across 350 poultries in the two districts, expected to meet the demand for a month.

The districts, considered poultry hubs, produce nearly 25 lakh broiler birds per month. Most poultry farmers have agreements with companies, such as Suguna, Sneha, Venkateshwara Hatcheries and Indian Broilers.

Poultry farmers are paid Rs 3 - Rs 4 per kilogram of broiler chicken by the companies, which also provide additional support and supply bird feed to them. Retailers are given a profit margin of Rs 25 - Rs 35 per kilogram.

In Sattupalli, which houses 115 poultry units, farmers have not been raising new birds for the past 15 days.

K. Dayakar, alias Nani, who runs a poultry farm in Sattupalli, said he has reduced the number of birds from 40,000 to 35,000 at present and plans to reduce it to 25,000 by the next week.

Citing a loss of at least five per cent of chicks during summer, he said, “We will not buy chicks in the next few weeks.”

Individual poultry farmers in the district account for nearly 3.2 lakh birds per month.

Sources said that traders will source chicken from other districts if the count falls below the 10 lakh mark, which is the monthly consumption in the two districts. A few traders are also importing birds from Odisha, among other states.

N. Rama Rao, an individual poultry farmer, said, “I lost 200 birds this summer. The price of chicken that has gone above Rs 250 per kilo was of immense benefit to traders than poultry farmers. Traders give farmers a slim margin, when compared to market rates.”

Alapati Ramu, a poultry farmer in Aswaraopet, said that farmers should construct poultry units amid coconut or palm groves to keep them cool. “Poultry units should be built facing north and south as east and west-facing units are hit by more sunlight,” he said.",[],2022-05-26 02:43:00+05:30,https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-ath7ouqsfvhkbcm4dm7ik682e5-20220302011304.Medi.jpeg,[],[],,"Mancherial,Peddapalli,Dummugudem,Sircilla,Karimnagar,Tirumalayapalem,Kamareddy,Sangareddy,Aswapuram,Raghunadhapalem,Mulug,Asifabad,Jagtial,Gundala,Nirmal,Medak,Kothagudem,Yellandu,Allapalli,Cherla,Gadwal,Krishna,Bhadrachalam","Khammam,Mulugu,Rajanna Sircilla,Karimnagar,Hyderabad,Bhadradri Kothagudem,Sangareddy,Jogulamba Gadwal,Siddipet,Kamareddy,Mancherial,Nirmal,Medak,Peddapalli,Adilabad,Jagtial,Nizamabad"
Mango production takes all time hit,"KHAMMAM: Summer is around and it is time to relish the yellow, pulpy and yummy mangoes of all sorts but the mouth-watering fruit seems to be playing hide-and-seek. The king of all fruits, the most sought after one during summer, is fast turning a rare commodity in the market. According to an estimate, mango production witnessed 70 per cent decline this year and farmers are said to be seriously considering alternative horticulture crops.

Mango production in the current year has come down drastically due to gales and pests attacks. Blossoming started in February instead of January. Though mango growers initially felt happy as flowering was high, unfortunately, blooming did not sustain due to the attack of pink worms, which was witnessed in chilli crops. Later, bed bugs attacked unripe fruits and it caused major damage to the production. Nearly 70 per cent of the flowering was dropped with it and the farmers were a worried lot. The yield of mango per acre in the general situation is 4,000 tonnes and it is now only 1,000 tonnes per acre.

Mandals like Sattupalli, Aswaraopet, Dammapet, Yellandu, Mulakalapalli, Madhira, Errupalem, Enkoor, Tallada, Penuballi, Konigerla and Vemsoor mandals in Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts used to export good quality of mangoes abroad and other states. The situation has changed now and farmers are expected to face heavy losses this year.

Mango is being raised in 34,000 acres in Khammam district and 11,000 acres in Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts. The average mango production is 1.36 lakh tonnes in Khammam and 44,000 tonnes in Bhadradri district. But, the farmers got the yield of only 12,000 tonnes and 3,000 tonnes so far in Khammam and Bhadradri districts respectively.

K. Srinivasa Rao, a mango grower in Penuballi said, “We are facing the worst situation this year pertaining to mango production. There is no chance of recovering the losses this year. I am planning to go for palm oil by felling mango trees in my six acres. A palm oil farmer is getting Rs 1 lakh rupees as lease per acre.”

It may be recalled that farmers in five mandals including Aswaraopet, Dammapet, Sattupalli and Penuballi felled their mango trees in the extent of 20,000 acres 15 years ago and raised palms and coconut trees. These farmers are now getting Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh as lease amount at present due to the increasing demand for edible oil after the war broke out between Russia and Ukraine.
