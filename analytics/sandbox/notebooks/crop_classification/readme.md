The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) partnered with the government of Telangana to develop programs to boost agricultural yields by putting in place policies that promote the best agricultural practices. In the Telangana state of India, UNDP is interested in identifying relevant cropland and the crops that are grown on these lands. Identifying the cropland and the crops grown on them will help develop sustainable agricultural policies and improve the yield of specific crops.
In this project, our aim is to use open-source geospatial data for developing a reliable model that identifies distinct crop types grown on smallholder farmlands in the state of Telangana.
To develop a proof of concept, we shall focus on identifying paddy, as this is one of the most grown and consumed stable crops in the Telangana region. Moreover, the stages of growth of the paddy crop, from its transplantation to its harvesting for the rabi and kharif seasons are well documented in literature.
