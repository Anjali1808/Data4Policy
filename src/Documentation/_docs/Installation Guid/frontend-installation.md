### Running Web App using Development Server

Steps:

1. Clone the github repo containing the frontend app `git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git`
2. Navigate to web_portal folder `cd dicra/src/web_portal`
3. Unzip package-lock.zip `unzip package-lock.zip`
4. Create .env file and add REACT_APP_API_KEY=google_map_api_key
5. Run the command `npm install` then it will install the required packages for running the application
6. After the installation we can able to run the Web application in Development server using the command `npm start`


### Running Web App Production Build In a web Server(Nginx)

Steps:

1. Clone the github repo containing the frontend app `git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git`
2. Navigate to web_portal folder `cd dicra/src/web_portal`
3. Unzip package-lock.zip `unzip package-lock.zip`
4. Create .env file and add REACT_APP_API_KEY=google_map_api_key
5. Run the command `npm install` then it will install the required packages for running the application.
6. To create the production build we need to run the command `npm run build`. After the successful execution of the command it will create a folder called `build`, it contain all the build files
7. Upload all the build files to nginx website deployment location
8. Make changes to the web server configuration


### Running Web App Production Build in Azure Blob
Steps:

1. Clone the github repo containing the frontend app `git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git`
2. Navigate to web_portal folder `cd dicra/src/web_portal`
3. Unzip package-lock.zip `unzip package-lock.zip`
4. Create .env file and add REACT_APP_API_KEY=google_map_api_key
5. Run the command `npm install` then it will install the required packages for running the application
6. To create the production build we need to run the command `npm run build`. After the successful execution of the command it will create a folder called `build`, it contain all the build files
7. To deploy react production build in Azure we need to create a storage account in Azure
8. After the successful Deployment of the storage account Goto static website menu and enable static website option and fill index document name as `index.html` and leave error document path as empty (its optional). After saving this it will provide us a primary endpoint.

   Screenshot of the same is given below. We can use the primary endpoint to test our react production build, deployed in the storage account and same can be done after the completion of step 6.

9. After the completion of Static website enabling section it will create two containers called `$logs` & `$web`. And we need to upload the build files created in step 3 to `$web` container. We can upload Build files to $web container using multiple ways ie., Azure storage explorer, Visual studio extension Azure storage by Microsoft

    Steps followed to upload build files to `$web` using Azure storage are

   * Goto azure storage extension on visual studio code
   * Sign In using Azure credentials
   * Expand storage account we have created for web app deployment
   * Under the Blob Container menu we can able to see `$web` container, right click on that, choose option Deploy to static website via azure storage, browse the build folder and complete the deployment.

    After completing the above steps we can test the deployment using the primary endpoint

10. Create CDN profile for the front end Create cdn profiles on Home->CDN profiles menu. after successful deployment of cdn profile, create cdn endpoint at the end point creation menu specify name as any meaningful name .
origin type : Storage static website origin hostname : the hostname generated by the url when completing the first step

    WE CAN ADD CUSTOM DOMAIN FOR OUR CDN HERE

11. Create Web application Firewall Policies (WAF) Goto home -> Web application Firewall Policies (WAF) menu Click create button On the basic tab under the project details section select AzureCDN Under the Instance details section select Policy mode select Prevention Add necessary custom rules under Custom rules tab Finally associate cdn end point at the Association tab and create the WAF policy
