# Crop Residue Burning in Telangana

## Background
UNDP has partnered with the Government of Telangana to jointly initiate the NextGenGov ‘Data for Policy’ initiative on Food Systems. The aim is to incorporate anticipatory governance models for future-fit food systems in Telangana using data-driven policymaking tools and ecosystem-driven approaches. UNDP is keen on augmenting learning capabilities, increasing the predictive or anticipatory capacity to feed into evidence-driven policies in the state, and create r radical traceability and transparency across the system from producers to consumers by building provenance documentation around food that can help build trust in the system at the same time nurture sustainable and healthy practices. The goal is to design, develop and demonstrate anticipatory governance models for food systems in Telangana using digital public goods and community-centric approaches to strengthen data-driven policymaking in the state.
The DiCRA platform is envisioned as a Digital Public Good that will strategically feed into data-driven decision-making in the state. The platform will have the capability to visualize and analyze high-resolution geospatial data (both vector as well as raster layers). The digital platform will curate, integrate and visualize such critical datasets and assets to answer the basic question of - What is growing where? How much is there and the spatial and temporal changes within the state across various indicators relevant to Agriculture and Food Systems? The platform should be able to visualize over time the changes that have happened to the agriculture ecosystem in terms of crop diversity, changes in soil/groundwater, tree cover, and other indicators at a higher resolution to support policy decisions. Such a synthesis of data and analytics can help identify farms that are doing exceptionally well (Positive Deviance) through which repositories of good practices and indigenous knowledge can be documented. This also helps in identifying farms that are not doing good as per the defined indicators (Negative Deviance).

## Crop Residue Burning in India
India is ranked at the top in emissions related to crop burning, accounting for 13% of total global emissions for the 2015-2020 period, according to a new report released by climate tech startup Blue Sky Analytics. An Indian Agricultural Research Institute study estimates that in 2008-09, the particulate released by crop residue burning is more than 17 times the total annual particulate pollution in Delhi from all sources—vehicles, industries, garbage burning, etc. Similarly, the total national annual emission for CO2 from crop residue burning is more than 64 times the total annual CO2 pollution emission in Delhi. India is the second-largest producer of rice worldwide. Paddy and wheat cropping are a widespread farming practice in northwestern parts of India; however, the burning of paddy and wheat straw and stubble by farmers after the harvesting season is quite common.

## Problem Statement

- How can we identify farming communities that are over time reducing the impact on the environment and health by curbing crop residue burning?
- Can non-traditional data sources help in identifying what they are doing or what changes have happened in their economic or social situation compared to communities that are still practicing crop/stubble burning?
- Identify datasets that can help quantify the practice of crop burning among rice farmers in India? This also calls for identifying areas under rice, cropping patterns, air quality indicators, etc.
- Identify positive deviant rice farms in India practicing Climate Smart Agriculture using non-traditional data sources such as mobile phone records, satellite imagery, social media, online data, or financial data.
- Identify changes in socio-economic or policy aspects in regions that are showing positive deviance.
- Diversifying crops, using crop residue for alternate purposes, in-situ management of crop residue, policy measures, etc. are recommended by officials to reduce crop burning. Can data sources help identify such practices and adaptations by communities?

**Ofcourse as part of this assessment we do not expect you to address all the problems, but we wanted to give you an overview of our goals with this project for better context**
